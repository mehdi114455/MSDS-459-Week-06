It is important to note that most of the time recall classifications are determined after the recalling firm provides all of the information needed to determine the risk posed to public health. The classification and posting in the FDA Enforcement Report should not be seen as an expansion or change to a firm’s voluntary public warning. Firms often initiate voluntary recalls and provide public statements or notifications as part of their commitment to protecting consumers, which may occur well before the FDA completes its classification process and subsequently posts to this report. What is the Enforcement Report? UPDATED!!! How do I subscribe to the Enforcement Report mailing list? What is a pending recall classification? What is the History feature? How are recalls categorized in the Enforcement Reports? How else does FDA provide early notification about recalls? Where do I find Additional Resources about Enforcement Reports? What if I have additional questions about Enforcement Reports? What is the Enforcement Report? All recalls monitored by FDA are included in the Enforcement Report once they are classified and may be listed prior to classification when FDA determines the firm’s removal or correction of a marketed product(s) meets the definition of a recall. Once FDA completes the hazard assessment, the Enforcement Report entry will be updated with the recall classification. Recall data in the Enforcement Report can be accessed through the weekly report publication, the quick and advanced search functionalities, and an Application Programming Interface (API). The recall information can also be seen under a number of different views . Instructions for navigating the report, accessing and using the API, and definitions of the report contents are found on the Enforcement Report Navigation and Definitions page . How do I subscribe to the Enforcement Report mailing list? The FDA Enforcement Report application subscription service allows individuals to register for e-mail notifications of new and updated FDA recalls posted to the application. Users can choose to be notified of all recalls, commodity specific recalls (i.e., Food, Devices, Drugs, etc.), or recalls based on keywords. These keywords can be product specific, such as \"cPAP\" or \"dog food\", brand name, or by reason for recall, such as \"peanut\" or \"sterility\". Users can also choose to subscribe to individual recall events on a daily or weekly basis. To subscribe, use this link or access the Enforcement Report application and click on the \"Subscribe to Recalls/Manage Preferences\" at the top of the page. What is a pending recall classification? On June 15, 2017, as part of a larger effort to increase transparency, empower consumers, and enhance public health, the Enforcement Report began listing recalls pending classification, or “not yet classified” recalls, in addition to classified recalls, to alert the public sooner whenever a product has been recalled. In these instances, the FDA has determined that a firm’s action meets the definition of a recall however the FDA has not completed its assessment of the hazard posed by the recalled product(s) yet – this is considered a pending classification. Once FDA completes the hazard assessment, the Enforcement Report entry will be updated with the recall classification (Class I, II or III) indicating the hazard posed by the recalled product(s). This initiative allows FDA to post certain recalls to the Enforcement Report sooner since the Agency is no longer waiting for the hazard assessment to be completed. What is the History feature? The Enforcement Report tracks and displays updates to a recall’s Classification, Reason for Recall, Code Information, and Product Description if changes occur after initial publication. This update history is available for all recalls posted or updated beginning July 24, 2018 and forward. Information for how these changes will appear and what parts of the Enforcement Report are effected can be found on the Enforcement Report History Feature page . How are recalls categorized in the Enforcement Reports? FDA considers a recall to be a firm's removal or correction of a marketed product that the FDA considers to be in violation of the laws it administers and against which the agency would initiate legal action. Separate from determining whether a firm’s action meets the definition of a recall, FDA also classifies a particular product recall to indicate the relative degree of health hazard (class I, II, or III) presented by the product being recalled. Recalls are categorized in the Enforcement Report as either class I, II, or III or \"not yet classified.\" How else does FDA provide early notification about recalls? FDA is conducting a trial pilot program to expedite notifications of Non-Blood (HCT/P, Vaccine, Derivative, etc.) product recalls to the public which can be found at Non-Blood Product On-Going Recalls . Where do I find additional resources about Enforcement Reports? For information gathered from press releases and other public notices about certain recalls of FDA-regulated products, you can visit Recalls, Market Withdrawals, & Safety Alerts . An additional enforcement tool is the Import Alert, which informs FDA field staff and the public that the agency has enough evidence to allow for Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) of products that appear to be in violation of FDA laws and regulations. More information can be found at Import Alerts . What if I have additional questions about Enforcement Reports?

Brand Name: Brand Name(s) Green Lumber Product Description: Product Description Dietary Supplement Company Announcement “The press release issued on 08/28/2025 was updated to clarify the recalled product lot number.” Costa Mesa, California — February 13, 2026 — Green Lumber Holding, LLC (“Green Lumber”) is issuing an updated consumer alert regarding counterfeit products falsely marketed as genuine Green Lumber products that may pose potential health risks. This update follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) February 9 publication in its Enforcement Report referencing Green Lumber’s original recall, which was initiated on August 28, 2025. The recall was issued in late August 2025 after FDA testing detected tadalafil—an undeclared prescription drug—in products labeled as Green Lumber. Tadalafil is not an ingredient in any authentic Green Lumber product. The February 9 Enforcement Report does not announce a new recall; it reflects publication of the previously announced August 28, 2025, recall. Following the FDA’s findings, Green Lumber conducted an internal investigation and determined that a company employee had misappropriated legitimate packaging and customer information to distribute counterfeit or adulterated products. That employee has been terminated. How to Identify the Counterfeit Recalled Product The counterfeit recalled product bears the Lot Number LOT308EXP03/28 – This is the only lot number being recalled and is not an authentic Green Lumber lot number and was used in connection with counterfeit products. Consumers should not use any product labeled with this lot number, and it should be discarded. How to Identify Legitimate Green Lumber Products Authentic Green Lumber products that are presently being distributed bear the following lot numbers and are not the subject of the recall: LOTGL0130151EXP0926 GL01EXP09/27 LOT GL110725 EXP110727 Packaging differences are illustrated in the image below, which compares genuine and counterfeit blister packs (authentic on left, counterfeit on right) . Health Risks of Counterfeit Products The counterfeit versions may contain undeclared tadalafil. Because tadalafil is a prescription-only medication, individuals who take nitrates or certain prescription drugs for heart disease, blood pressure, or other conditions may be at risk of life-threatening side effects such as dangerously low blood pressure or other serious adverse events. What Consumers Should Do Check your packaging : Confirm that your blister packs show one of the following Lot Numbers LOTGL0130151EXP0926; GL01EXP09/27; or GL110725 EXP110727 Immediately discontinue use of any product bearing the Lot number LOT308EXP03/28 . Report suspected counterfeit product directly to Green Lumber at [phone/email] and to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program. Seek medical care promptly if you experience unexpected side effects after using the mislabeled product. Company Response “Consumer safety is our number one priority,” said Brett Hales, President. “We acted swiftly after the FDA’s testing identified tadalafil in a product labeled as ours. Our investigation revealed that an employee had been diverting our packaging and customer channels to sell counterfeit goods. That individual has been terminated, and we have strengthened our safeguards to protect customers and ensure this does not happen again.” Green Lumber has cooperated with the FDA and law enforcement from the beginning to address this matter and protect consumers.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

To date, there have been 7 illnesses resulting in 3 hospitalizations across the United States due to Salmonella contamination, 3 of which may be linked to a single product. At this time, the FDA and CDC have reported that the outbreak may be linked to Rosabella Moringa Capsules. We continue to diligently investigate, in collaboration with FDA, this possible link of the Salmonella outbreak to Rosebella Moringa Capsules. We have discontinued use and purchase of all raw moringa leaf powder from the raw material supplier of the above referenced lots. Customers who have purchased the lots above are asked to dispose of it immediately, do not eat, sell, or serve the product.

People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk or soy run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.

Chocolate Cherry and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Junebars stamped with the label L1300, L1300A, L1300B, or L1301A. One customer reported an allergic reaction to milk, which is how Junebar became aware of the undeclared allergen and opened an investigation. Investigation indicates the problem was caused by an oversight in the company's sourcing process that caused a box of non-vegan chocolate chips, which contain milk and soy, to be included in production. Typically Junebars are made with dairy free, soy free chips. This recall was initiated immediately after the allergen’s presence was discovered. Consumers who have purchased the recalled Chocolate Cherry or Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Junebars are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Neogen distributes this product, which is manufactured by a third-party supplier. This recall has been initiated due to microbial contamination in certain lots of 10 mL/50 mg product vials.

Brand Name: Brand Name(s) Green Lumber Product Description: Product Description Dietary Supplement Company Announcement Costa Mesa, California August 28, 2025 - Green Lumber Holding, LLC (“Green Lumber”) is alerting consumers that counterfeit products misrepresented as genuine Green Lumber have been identified and may pose health risks. This alert follows testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , which detected tadalafil, an undeclared prescription drug, in products labeled as Green Lumber. Tadalafil is not an ingredient in any authentic Green Lumber product. Based on the FDA’s findings, Green Lumber conducted its own internal investigation and determined that a company employee diverted legitimate packaging and customer information to distribute counterfeit, adulterated product. That employee has since been terminated. How to Identify Legitimate Green Lumber Product Consumers should verify product authenticity by checking packaging details: Authentic Green Lumber blister packs display Lot Number: LOTGLU13101b1EXP0926. Counterfeit products do not show this lot number. Packaging differences are illustrated in the image below, which compares genuine and counterfeit blister packs ( authentic on left, counterfeit on right ). Health Risks of Counterfeit Products The counterfeit versions may contain undeclared tadalafil. Because tadalafil is a prescription-only medication, individuals who take nitrates or certain prescription drugs for heart disease, blood pressure, or other conditions may be at risk of life-threatening side effects such as dangerously low blood pressure or other serious adverse events. What Consumers Should Do Check your packaging: Confirm that your blister packs show Lot Number LOTGLU13101b1EXP0926. Immediately discontinue use of any product not bearing this lot number. Report suspected counterfeit product directly to Green Lumber at [phone/email] and to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program. Seek medical care promptly if you experience unexpected side effects after using the mislabeled product. Company Response “Consumer safety is our number one priority,” said Brett Hales, President. “We acted swiftly after FDA’s testing identified tadalafil in a product labeled as ours. Our investigation revealed that an employee had been diverting our packaging and customer channels to sell counterfeit goods. That individual has been terminated, and we have strengthened our safeguards to protect customers and ensure this does not happen again.” Green Lumber is working cooperatively with FDA and law enforcement to address this matter and protect consumers.

Firms often initiate voluntary recalls and provide public statements or notifications as part of their commitment to protecting consumers, which may occur well before the FDA completes its classification process and subsequently posts to this report. FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is beginning a pilot program intended to expedite notifications of Non-Blood (HCT/P, Vaccine, Derivative, etc) product recalls that are classified under the Direct Recall Classification (DRC) Program to the public. CBER's DRC Program decreases the resources needed to classify and publish recalls, and allows the reallocation of resources to other agency priorities related to protection of the public health. In addition to the information about classified recalls found in the weekly Enforcement Report , the agency will include actions that have been determined to be on-going recalls and that have been classified as Class I, II or III. These select Non-Blood recalls will be republished with their final classification once the firm's recall is complete. Please send comments or suggestions to CBER_RecallAlerts@fda.hhs.gov .

What if I have additional questions about Enforcement Reports? What is the Enforcement Report? All recalls monitored by FDA are included in the Enforcement Report once they are classified and may be listed prior to classification when FDA determines the firm’s removal or correction of a marketed product(s) meets the definition of a recall. Once FDA completes the hazard assessment, the Enforcement Report entry will be updated with the recall classification. Recall data in the Enforcement Report can be accessed through the weekly report publication, the quick and advanced search functionalities, and an Application Programming Interface (API). The recall information can also be seen under a number of different views . Instructions for navigating the report, accessing and using the API, and definitions of the report contents are found on the Enforcement Report Navigation and Definitions page . How do I subscribe to the Enforcement Report mailing list? The FDA Enforcement Report application subscription service allows individuals to register for e-mail notifications of new and updated FDA recalls posted to the application. Users can choose to be notified of all recalls, commodity specific recalls (i.e., Food, Devices, Drugs, etc.), or recalls based on keywords. These keywords can be product specific, such as \"cPAP\" or \"dog food\", brand name, or by reason for recall, such as \"peanut\" or \"sterility\". Users can also choose to subscribe to individual recall events on a daily or weekly basis. To subscribe, use this link or access the Enforcement Report application and click on the \"Subscribe to Recalls/Manage Preferences\" at the top of the page. What is a pending recall classification? On June 15, 2017, as part of a larger effort to increase transparency, empower consumers, and enhance public health, the Enforcement Report began listing recalls pending classification, or “not yet classified” recalls, in addition to classified recalls, to alert the public sooner whenever a product has been recalled. In these instances, the FDA has determined that a firm’s action meets the definition of a recall however the FDA has not completed its assessment of the hazard posed by the recalled product(s) yet – this is considered a pending classification. Once FDA completes the hazard assessment, the Enforcement Report entry will be updated with the recall classification (Class I, II or III) indicating the hazard posed by the recalled product(s). This initiative allows FDA to post certain recalls to the Enforcement Report sooner since the Agency is no longer waiting for the hazard assessment to be completed. What is the History feature? The Enforcement Report tracks and displays updates to a recall’s Classification, Reason for Recall, Code Information, and Product Description if changes occur after initial publication. This update history is available for all recalls posted or updated beginning July 24, 2018 and forward. Information for how these changes will appear and what parts of the Enforcement Report are effected can be found on the Enforcement Report History Feature page . How are recalls categorized in the Enforcement Reports? FDA considers a recall to be a firm's removal or correction of a marketed product that the FDA considers to be in violation of the laws it administers and against which the agency would initiate legal action. Separate from determining whether a firm’s action meets the definition of a recall, FDA also classifies a particular product recall to indicate the relative degree of health hazard (class I, II, or III) presented by the product being recalled. Recalls are categorized in the Enforcement Report as either class I, II, or III or \"not yet classified.\" How else does FDA provide early notification about recalls? FDA is conducting a trial pilot program to expedite notifications of Non-Blood (HCT/P, Vaccine, Derivative, etc.) product recalls to the public which can be found at Non-Blood Product On-Going Recalls . Where do I find additional resources about Enforcement Reports? For information gathered from press releases and other public notices about certain recalls of FDA-regulated products, you can visit Recalls, Market Withdrawals, & Safety Alerts . An additional enforcement tool is the Import Alert, which informs FDA field staff and the public that the agency has enough evidence to allow for Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) of products that appear to be in violation of FDA laws and regulations.

General FDA Warning Letters When FDA identifies what it believes are significant violation(s) of federal requirement(s), FDA notifies the appropriate party. This notification is often in the form of a Warning Letter. The Warning Letter identifies the concern(s), such as poor manufacturing practices, problems with claims for what a product can do, or incorrect directions for use. The letter provides an opportunity for the company or individual to address FDA's concerns and requests a response with a certain timeframe. This response could consist of plans for correction and FDA would then check to ensure that the corrections are adequate. To the extent the company or individual disagrees with the FDA's concerns, the company or individual has the opportunity to supply FDA with its reasoning and supporting information. These communications and other actions by FDA and/or the recipient of the letter may change the regulatory status of the issues discussed in the letter. View general FDA warning letters Tobacco Retail Warning Letters Compliance check inspections of tobacco retailers occur periodically, and are conducted to determine a retail establishment’s compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) and its regulations in effect, such as the Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents , found at Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1140 (21 C.F.R. Part 1140). Tobacco products covered in compliance check inspections of tobacco retailers include cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.

View drug marketing and advertising Warning Letters Warning Letter Close-Out Letter Program (applies to letters issued on or after Sept. 1, 2009) FDA may issue a Warning Letter close-out letter (\"close-out letter\") once the Agency has completed an evaluation of corrective actions undertaken by a firm in response to a Warning Letter. A close-out letter may issue when, based on FDA’s evaluation, the firm has taken corrective action to address the violations contained in the Warning Letter. This procedure applies to Warning Letters issued on or after September 1, 2009. A close-out letter will not be issued based on representations that some action will or has been taken. The corrective actions must actually have been made and verified by FDA. Usually, the standard for verifying that corrections have been implemented will be a follow-up inspection. If the Warning Letter contains violations that by their nature are not correctable, then no close-out letter will issue. Future FDA inspections and regulatory activities may further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these corrections. Should violations be observed during a subsequent inspection or through other means, enforcement action may be taken without further notice. The FDA office that issued the Warning Letter will issue the close-out letter, and that office may be contacted for information on a particular Warning Letter or close-out letter.", "relevance": 11, "mentions": []}

During the inspection, the investigators noted serious deficiencies in your practices for producing drug products, which put patients at risk. FDA issued a Form FDA 483 to your firm on June 9, 2025. FDA acknowledges receipt of your facility’s responses, dated July 1, 2025, and July 31, 2025. FDA further acknowledges that on July 9, 2025, your firm initiated a voluntary recall of all drug products, within expiry, with out-of-specification (OOS) results, including all drug product lots/sub lots that were filled from the same bulk stock solution. FDA also acknowledges that you ceased production of all GLP-1 drug products intended to be sterile and, on August 20, 2025, notified FDA of an intent to resume production of such products. Based on this inspection, it appears that you produced drug products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). A. Compounded Drug Products Under the FDCA Section 503A of the FDCA describes the conditions under which human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or a licensed physician, qualify for exemptions from three sections of the FDCA: compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) (section 501(a)(2)(B)); labeling with adequate directions for use (section 502(f)(1)); and FDA approval prior to marketing (section 505) [21 U.S.C. §§ 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1) and 355(a)]. B. Violations of the FDCA Adulterated Drug Products The FDA investigators noted that drug products intended or expected to be sterile were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions, whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health, causing your drug products to be adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA. For example, the investigators observed that: 1. Your firm failed to perform adequate smoke studies under dynamic conditions to demonstrate unidirectional airflow within the ISO 5 area. Therefore, your products intended to be sterile are produced in an environment that may not provide adequate protection against the risk of contamination. 2. Production areas have difficult to clean or contain porous, particle generating, or visibly dirty equipment or surfaces. Additionally, the FDA investigators noted that your firm released and distributed drug products with strengths that differed from their labeled amounts. For example, your Fluorescein 2% Ophthalmic Solution was subpotent (lots # 01242025@ (b)(4) , potency of 85.865% and 03272025@ (b)(4) , potency of 76.1475%). Under section 501(b) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 351(b)], a drug is deemed to be adulterated if it purports to be or is represented as a drug the name of which is recognized in an official compendium and its strength differs from, or its quality or purity falls below, the standard set forth in such compendium. Accordingly, your Fluorescein 2% Ophthalmic Solution is adulterated under section 501(b) of FDCA. Furthermore, the FDA investigators noted that your firm released and distributed drug products that failed sterility testing. For example, your Tirzepatide 17mg/mL / Glycine 5mg/mL / Methylcobalamin 5mg/mL Injection (lot # 04072025@ (b)(4) ). In addition, the investigators noted that your firm released and distributed drug products with strengths that differed from their labeled amounts. For example, your Semaglutide 2.5mg/mL Injection was subpotent (lot # 03042025@ (b)(4) , potency of 79.876%) and your Tirzepatide 10mg/mL Injection was subpotent (lots # 01172025@ (b)(4) , potency of 86.779% and 02112025@ (b)(4) , potency of 89.13%). Under section 501(c) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 351(c)], a drug is deemed to be adulterated if it is unrecognized in an official compendium and its strength differs from, or its quality or purity falls below, that which it purports or is represented to possess. Accordingly, your Semaglutide 2.5mg/mL Injection and Tirzepatide 10mg/mL Injection are adulterated under section 501(c) of the FDCA. Under section 301(a) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)], the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being adulterated. Misbranded Drug Products The strength of compounded drugs, for example your Fluorescein 2 % Ophthalmic Solution, Semaglutide 2.5mg/mL Injection, and Tirzepatide 10mg/mL Injection, differed from and fell below their labeled strength. Under section 502(a) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 352(a)], a drug product is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Because the labeling of these drug products is false or misleading, they are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FDCA. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these drug products therefore violates section 301(a) of the FDCA. It is also a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being misbranded. C. Corrective Actions We have reviewed your firm’s responses to the Form FDA 483. We further acknowledge that on July 9, 2025, your firm initiated a voluntary recall of all drug products, within expiry, with OOS results, including all drug product lots/sub lots that were filled from the same bulk stock solution. We also acknowledge that you ceased production of all GLP-1 drug products intended to be sterile and, on August 20, 2025, notified FDA of an intent to resume production of such products. Regarding your responses related to the insanitary conditions, some of your corrective actions appear adequate; however, we cannot fully evaluate the adequacy of the following corrective actions described in your response because you did not include sufficient information or supporting documentation: 1. Regarding the repeat deficiencies identified in your smoke studies, your firm indicated that new smoke studies were performed on 07/30/2025 using protocols (b)(4) and (b)(4) . However, you did not provide copies of these protocols and the corresponding new smoke studies. Without this supporting documentation, your firm’s assertion that the new smoke studies demonstrate and reflect the following corrective actions cannot be verified: a. “Updated smoke studies will clearly demonstrate that ISO 5 air is not compromised by air entering from the surrounding ISO 7 zone, using improved camera positioning and multiple angles to ensure complete visibility of the airflow boundary.” b. “Studies will accurately reflect production practices, including the appropriate use of one or more operators when applicable, and all roles and workflows will be documented and aligned with routine compounding procedures.” c. “First air protection over critical items such as bulk solution containers, stopper trays, and vial caps will be explicitly visualized, with clear footage showing that airflow remains unidirectional and undisturbed across all critical points.” d. “The issues observed in videos from BSC [Biological Safety Cabinet] units CEC#01983 and CEC#02166, such as stagnant airflow, arched patterns, backflow, and handling techniques, will be rectified by updated studies conducted under revised aseptic workflows. Technician retraining and procedural modifications have already begun to address these technique-related risks.” e. “[Camera] positioning and lighting have been optimized to ensure that first pass air is clearly visible over all active work areas, with no blind spots during critical manipulations.” In addition, you provided aseptic visual aids (Exhibit 12a - Aseptic Visual Aids, Pg. 79) that depicted airflow patterns in the ISO 5 BSC. These visual aids showed turbulence and no first air observed in the central area near the work surface (or deck) due to the air being pulled by the front and back vents inside the BSC. Given that your firm produces the majority of drug products intended to be sterile on the deck of a BSC, it remains unclear whether your firm has assessed and modified your aseptic procedures to adequately address this airflow deficiency. 2. Regarding your production areas having surfaces that are difficult to clean or contain porous, particle generating surfaces, your firm provided several documents: the reconstruction floor plan for the remodeling of PS-112 cleanroom suite, the construction proposal and repairs punch list, and images of the ceiling tiles and walls of the newly remodeled area still under construction. However, you did not include adequate information or supporting documentation for review, including but not limited to: a. Specification documentation of the ceiling tiles used in the remodel; b. Documentation demonstrating these tiles are suitable for pharmaceutical use and cleaning protocols; c. Updated cleanroom certification report; and d. Environmental monitoring data for the remodeled cleanroom suite. Based on the images provided in your responses, it is unclear whether the ceiling tiles were properly caulked or if gaps exist between the ceiling tiles. Additionally, it remains unclear whether these newly constructed cleanroom areas meet the standards required to support the resumption of sterile production. While your responses indicate that the original interior walls in rooms PS-112 and PS-112A were replaced with PVC (including in the newly created room PS-114), insufficient information or supporting documentation were provided for review, including but not limited to: a. Specification documentation for the PVC wall paneling; and b. Documentation demonstrating that these PVC paneling are appropriate for pharmaceutical use and cleaning. Regarding your responses related to other adulteration issues, the following corrective actions appear deficient: 1. Regarding your firm releasing drug products where strength differs from, or quality or purity falls below, that which the products purport or are represented to possess, your firm’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) contain conflicting provisions regarding release of drug products intended to be sterile prior to receiving final sterility testing results raising significant concerns about product quality and patient safety. In your response, you provided SOP ID: CP.GENCMPD.016.001 Compounded Sterile Preparation Batch Release which states, “ (b)(4) .\" However, section 6.5.1 of the same SOP states, “ (b)(4) .” These two statements in the same SOP appear to be contradictory, and you have not provided any scientific justification for releasing ophthalmic drug products intended to be sterile prior to receiving the final sterility test results, nor clarified whether patients or prescribers will be notified of the “at risk” status. This concern is heightened given your firm’s documented history of sterility failures of drug products intended to be sterile, where patients were not notified of these failures. Furthermore, SOP ID: CP.GENCMPD.016.002 Batch Release Record, section 6.4.2 states, “If risk release is authorized by patient or prescriber, the Lab pharmacist may retrieve the products required for that specific RX from the designated hold area.” This provision indicates that any sterile drug product may be released “at risk”, without limiting this practice to ophthalmic preparations or excluding other categories of human drug products intended to be sterile. Additionally, the procedure does not specify whether you would inform the prescribers or patients in cases where the drug product subsequently fails sterility testing. Based on these SOPs, your firm's actual policy for “at risk” product release remains unclear, creating potential compliance issues and patient safety risks. You acknowledged that the release of compounded preparations that were OOS “reflects a deviation from [your] internal quality assurance procedures and [your] obligation to notify patients and prescribers upon discovery of any compromise to product strength, sterility, or potency.” However, you did not provide corrective actions addressing this deviation for failure to notify patients and prescribers when OOS’s were identified. Section 6.8 SOP ID: CP.GENCMPD.016.001 states, “Any OOS results must be immediately reported to quality and the pharmacist-in-charge. Investigation and root cause analysis should be performed when applicable per SOP QA.CAPA.016.001 Variance and OOS Investigations. A recall and customer notification procedures shall be followed when applicable.” This language indicates that investigation, root cause analysis, recall, and customer notification are only required \"when applicable” rather than for every OOS occurrence. In addition, the SOP lacks defined timeframes for both patient/prescriber notification and investigation procedures following OOS occurrences. In addition, during the inspection, investigators reviewed 23 variance/OOS investigation reports from November 2024 through May 2025; none of these reports followed your SOP for investigating OOS results, and none of the investigations included documentation of contacting the patient by your firm. Of these 23, nineteen variance/OOS investigations remained open at the time of the inspection. It remains unclear whether these variance/OOS investigation reports have since been closed and whether the affected patients and/or their healthcare providers have been notified. There is no assurance that you will adhere to your own SOP procedures moving forward. Your responses did not identify or discuss the root cause(s) for the numerous sterility and potency OOS results for your drug products intended to be sterile. Between July 2, 2024 and May 1, 2025, your firm distributed drug products intended to be sterile that failed to meet sterility and potency specifications, including (b)(4) lots with sterility failures and approximately (b)(4) lots with potency failures (for human use). Given the substantial number of OOS results at your facility, particularly potency failures, section 6.1.2 of your SOP ID: CP.GENCMPD.016.001 Compounded Sterile Preparation Batch Release states: “ (b)(4) .” However, this section suggests you conduct potency testing on a selective basis rather than testing every lot or sub lot that is produced. Please be aware that section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA concerning insanitary conditions applies regardless of whether drug products you compound meet the conditions of section 503A. FDA strongly recommends that your management undertake a comprehensive assessment of operations, including facility design, procedures, personnel, processes, maintenance, materials, and systems. In particular, this review should assess your aseptic processing operations. A third-party consultant with relevant sterile drug manufacturing expertise should assist you in conducting this comprehensive evaluation. D. Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to address any violations. Failure to adequately address any violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Please include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you believe your products are not in violation of the FDCA, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot completely address this matter within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time in which you will do so. Your response and any questions regarding the contents of this letter should be sent to compoundinginspections@fda.hhs.gov. In your response, refer to the Warning Letter Number above (# 717525) and include a subject line that clearly identifies the submission as a Response to Warning Letter. Sincerely, /S/ Matthew J.

This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed your August 29, 2025, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following. 1. Your firm failed to perform operations within specifically defined areas of adequate size and to have separate or defined areas or such other control systems necessary to prevent contamination or mix-ups (21 CFR 211.42(c)). You manufacture (b)(4) over-the-counter (OTC) (b)(4) drug products and (b)(4) containing drug products in a shared facility, using multiple pieces of shared equipment. For example, (b)(4) was used to manufacture (b)(4) containing (b)(4) prior to manufacturing ORL kids bubblegum toothpaste. You manipulate and manufacture drugs with potent active ingredients without adequate facility separation to prevent cross-contamination of other drug products. Your (b)(4) drug products contain (b)(4) . Contamination of (b)(4) drug products with potent (b)(4) presents significant risk to patient safety. In your response, you state that “exhaust systems or other systems to control contaminants are under study.” However, our investigation identified use of non-dedicated equipment in a shared facility. Your response is inadequate because it does not address how you will ensure there are adequate facility and equipment controls to prevent cross contamination. Contamination is generally nonuniformly distributed. Data obtained from retrospectively testing a small proportion of a batch (e.g., retain samples) is limited in its ability to retrospectively assess the extent of contamination in other portions of a batch. The lowest or highest results obtained from testing a small sample size is unlikely to reveal the true range of minimum and maximum contamination level that exists in a batch exposed to the contamination hazards identified at your firm. Consequently, the range of variability of contamination levels in batches produced by your firm remain characterized by substantial residual uncertainty. Because of the limitations of retrospective testing in gaining a representative understanding of the entire lot, testing retain samples alone is insufficient to determine the scope of the contamination issues and mitigate the associated risks. Further evaluation and scientific rationale is needed in your firm’s risk assessment to reflect the nature of cross-contamination events and determine the degree of cross-contamination risk that may be posed to a portion of marketed batches. On December 2, 2025, FDA held a teleconference with you recommending you consider removing any batches of ORL Kid’s Natural Toothpaste and ORL Kid’s mouthwash currently in distribution from the U.S. market. On December 8, 2025, you issued a voluntarily recall of ORL kids bubblegum toothpaste lot number 250520P4-05/27 and ORL kids bubblegum mouthwash lot number 250505P9-05/27 due to potential contamination with exogenous hormones. In response to this letter, provide: A comprehensive, independent assessment of the design and control of your firm’s manufacturing operations with a detailed and thorough review of all (b)(4) , and other active ingredient, cross-contamination hazards. Confirmation of whether you will discontinue manufacturing drugs on shared equipment in your facility and implement appropriate controls to prevent cross-contamination. Your plan to perform testing to identify (b)(4) contamination in all your drug products. Any testing performed to identify (b)(4) contamination should be scientifically sound, include appropriate sampling plans and test procedures, including methods that are appropriately validated, suitable for intended use, and sufficiently sensitive. A detailed risk assessment addressing the hazards posed by distributing drug products potentially contaminated with (b)(4) . Specify actions you will take in response to the risk assessment, such as customer notifications and product recalls. A summary of updated standard operating procedures (SOPs) that ensure an appropriate program is in place for verification and validation of cleaning procedures for products, processes, and equipment. 2. Your firm failed to clean, maintain, and, as appropriate for the nature of the drug, sanitize and/or sterilize equipment and utensils at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug product beyond the official or other established requirements (21 CFR 211.67(a)). You failed to ensure your cleaning procedures are adequate to prevent cross-contamination of (b)(4) OTC drug products with the potent (b)(4) (e.g., (b)(4) ). For example, you have inadequate cleaning validation for your non-dedicated manufacturing equipment. In your response, you state that your cleaning and sanitization SOP has been updated and that dirty and damaged equipment components have been replaced. Cleaning to prevent cross contamination with potent ingredients on shared equipment is extremely difficult and unacceptable. (b)(4) in (b)(4) OTC (b)(4) products pose a significant risk to public health. In children, exposure to even low levels of (b)(4) can lead to developmental and reproductive harm. Therefore, dedication of facilities and equipment should be considered. In response to this letter, provide: A risk assessment for all drug products you have previously produced on shared equipment. For each product, assess the risk of potential contamination due to the shared equipment. Also, provide your plans for addressing the product quality and patient safety risks for any product still in distribution, including potential recalls or market withdrawals. A comprehensive, independent retrospective assessment of your cleaning effectiveness to evaluate the scope of cross-contamination hazards. Include the identity of residues, other manufacturing equipment that may have been improperly cleaned, and an assessment whether cross-contaminated products may have been released for distribution. The assessment should identify any inadequacies of cleaning procedures and practices and encompass each piece of manufacturing equipment used to manufacture more than one product. A corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan based on the retrospective assessment of your cleaning and disinfection program. Include appropriate remediations to your cleaning and disinfection processes and practices and timelines for completion. Provide a detailed summary of vulnerabilities in your process for lifecycle management of equipment cleaning and disinfection. Describe improvements to your cleaning and disinfection program, including enhancements to cleaning effectiveness, improved ongoing verification of proper cleaning and disinfection execution for all products and equipment, and all other needed remediations. Evidence of the establishment of a cleaning validation program with special emphasis on incorporating conditions identified as worst case in your drug manufacturing operation. This should include, but not be limited to, identification and evaluation of all worst-case: o Drugs with higher toxicities o Drugs with higher drug potencies o Drugs of lower solubility in their cleaning solvents o Drugs with characteristics that make their residue difficult to clean o Swabbing locations for areas that are most difficult to clean o Maximum hold times before cleaning The steps that must be taken in your change management system before introduction of new manufacturing equipment or a new product. A summary of updated SOPs that ensure an appropriate program is in place for verification and validation of cleaning procedures for products, processes, and equipment. 3. Your firm failed to have, for each batch of drug product, appropriate laboratory determination of satisfactory conformance to final specifications for the drug product, including the identity and strength of each active ingredient, prior to release. Your firm failed to conduct, for each batch of drug product, appropriate laboratory testing, as necessary, required to be free of objectionable microorganisms (21 CFR 211.165(a) and 211.165(b)). You released finished drug products without adequate testing. For example, you did not perform adequate microbiological monitoring and chemical testing on your finished drug products. Further, you did not adequately validate the method you use for assay testing your bulk (b)(4) containing drug products. Your response states that you do not “produce any products that are drugs.” Your response is inadequate because your drug products are subject to CGMP requirements. Further, your response does not indicate that you will test your finished drug products to ensure they meet appropriate specifications. Drug product batches must be tested for identity, strength, and purity prior to release. Testing is essential to ensure that the drug products you manufacture conform to all predetermined quality attributes appropriate for their intended use. Without adequate finished product release testing, you do not have scientific evidence that each batch of drug product conforms to appropriate specifications before release. In your response to this letter, provide: A comprehensive independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system. A list of chemical and microbial specifications, including test methods, used to analyze each batch of your drug products before a batch disposition decision. An action plan and timelines for conducting full chemical and microbiological testing of reserve samples to determine the quality of all batches of drug products distributed to the United States that are within expiry as of the date of this letter. A summary of all results obtained from testing reserve samples from each batch. If this testing reveals substandard quality drug products, take rapid corrective actions, such as notifying customers and product recalls. 4. Your firm failed to establish an adequate quality unit and the responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not in writing and fully followed (21 CFR 211.22(a) and 211.22(d)). You lacked adequate quality unit (QU) oversight for the manufacture of your drug products. For example, your QU failed to ensure: Adequate testing of incoming raw materials, including performing identity testing of each shipment of each component (e.g. (b)(4) ) used in the manufacture of your drug products (21 CFR 211.84(d)(2)) Adequate laboratory controls and specifications (21 CFR 211.160(b)) Adequate design and procedures for production and process controls for drug products and for maintenance and monitoring of your (b)(4) used to manufacture drug products (21 CFR 211.100(a)) Adequate investigations into non-conformances (21 CFR 211.192) Establishment of a written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products and to use results of stability testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 CFR 211.166(a)) In your response, you again state that you do not manufacture any drug products. You further state that you updated your procedures to more clearly define the roles of the QU. Your response is inadequate because you do not address how you plan to ensure that your quality unit has sufficient resources to carry out its responsibilities and consistently ensure drug quality. You also do not address how you will maintain completeness and accuracy of the records used for batch release and other quality review decisions. Significant findings in this letter demonstrate that your firm does not operate an effective quality system in accord with CGMP. In addition to the lack of effective management oversight of your production and laboratory operations, we found your quality unit is not enabled to exercise proper authority and/or has insufficiently implemented its responsibilities. Executive management should immediately and comprehensively assess your company’s global manufacturing operations to ensure that your systems, processes, and products conform to FDA requirements. See FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download. In your response to this letter, provide: A comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure your QU is given the authority and resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited to: o A determination of whether procedures used by your firm are robust and appropriate o Provisions for QU oversight throughout your operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practices o A complete and final review of each batch and its related information before the QU disposition decision o Oversight and approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all products Also describe how top management supports quality assurance and reliable operations, including, but not limited to, timely provision of resources to proactively address emerging manufacturing/quality issues and to assure a continuing state of control. Responsibilities as a Contractor Drugs must be manufactured in conformance with CGMP. FDA is aware that many drug manufacturers use independent contractors such as production facilities, testing laboratories, packagers, and labelers. FDA regards contractors as extensions of the manufacturer. You are responsible for the quality of drugs you produce as a contract facility regardless of agreements in place with product owners. You are required to ensure that drugs are made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act for safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. See FDA’s guidance document Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements at https://www.fda.gov/media/86193/download. Repeat Violations at Facility In a previous warning letter CMS 545017, dated July 31, 2018, FDA cited similar CGMP violations. You proposed specific remediation for these violations in your response. Repeated failures demonstrate that executive management oversight and control over the manufacture of drugs are inadequate. Drug Consultant Recommended It is the responsibility of each person marketing and distributing drug products in the United States to comply with the requirements of the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. Should you have questions concerning the laws and regulations for the products manufactured by your firm, including the products manufactured for contract customers, we recommend that you retain the services of a drug law consultant for assistance. Because you failed to correct repeat violations, you should engage a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to evaluate your operations and to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. The qualified consultant should also perform a comprehensive six-system audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of your CAPA before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status with FDA. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address this matter may result in regulatory or legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Unresolved violations may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts. Failure to address violations may also cause FDA to withhold issuance of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to address any violations. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov.

Dacey, M.D. 425 South Cherry Street, Suite 907 Denver , CO 80246-1242 United States Issuing Office: Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) United States WARNING LETTER FDA Ref. No.: 26-HFD-45-02-01 Dear Dr. Dacey: This Warning Letter informs you of objectionable conditions observed during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection conducted at your clinical site between October 23 and November 8, 2024. The investigator representing FDA reviewed your conduct of the following clinical investigations: • Protocol (b)(4) , “ (b)(4) ,” of the investigational drug (b)(4) , performed for (b)(4) • Protocol (b)(4) , “ (b)(4) ,” of the investigational drug (b)(4) , performed for (b)(4) This inspection was conducted as a part of FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which includes inspections designed to evaluate the conduct of research and to help ensure that the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects have been protected. At the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA investigator presented and discussed with you the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your December 3, 2024, written response to the Form FDA 483. From our review of the FDA Establishment Inspection Report, the documents submitted with that report, and your written response dated December 3, 2024, it appears that you did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and applicable regulations contained in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 312 (21 CFR 312) and 50 (21 CFR 50) governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects. We wish to emphasize the following: You failed to obtain informed consent in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR part 50 [21 CFR 312.60 and 21 CFR 50.20]. As a clinical investigator, you are required to obtain informed consent in accordance with 21 CFR part 50. FDA’s regulations at 21 CFR 50.20 state that, except as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 21 CFR 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by the regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative. You failed to obtain legally effective informed consent for Subject (b)(6) , who was enrolled in Protocol (b)(4) , before the collection of optional aqueous humor samples. Specifically, Protocol (b)(4) required subjects to sign the appropriate informed consent form for participation in the collection and submission of optional aqueous humor samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. However, Subject (b)(6) underwent the collection of aqueous humor from the study eye on March 5, 2024 (Week 20), even though the subject declined consent on September 26 and October 18, 2023, for the collection and submission of optional aqueous humor samples. In your December 3, 2024, written response to the Form FDA 483, you stated that the site inadvertently collected the aqueous humor sample for Subject (b)(6) at the March 5, 2024 (Week 20) visit. You stated that on March 20, 2024, the medical monitor notified the site of the incident. Following this notification, the issue was reported to the IRB, and Subject (b)(6) was notified of the inadvertent aqueous humor sample collection at their next visit. You stated that the request for sample destruction was submitted to the central lab, and the sponsor confirmed the destruction. You also stated that to prevent a similar occurrence, the site will use quick-reference labels on subjects’ source binders and/or the site will use an informed consent form tracking feature for optional procedures in the site’s RealTime Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS). Further, you stated that the labeling of source binders and/or notation in the RealTime CTMS will be implemented at the Principal Investigator’s new practice location to ensure compliance for current and future research activities. While we acknowledge the corrective and preventive actions that your site has taken and plans to take, your written response is inadequate because you did not provide sufficient details about how you, as the clinical investigator, will ensure adequate oversight of study procedures. Specifically, you did not provide information about how the labeling of source binders or notation in the RealTime CTMS will be implemented at your site, including training for you as the clinical investigator and for the site staff, so that these procedures are used to accurately determine a subject’s consent for optional procedures during a clinical investigation. Without this information, we are unable to determine whether your corrective actions appear adequate to prevent similar violations in future clinical investigations. We also remain concerned that in this clinical investigation, it was clearly documented in Subject (b)(6) ’s records that the subject twice declined consent, yet the optional sample collection procedure was performed. As a result, the subject was exposed to unnecessary potential risks from the performance of this procedure, such as blurred vision, bleeding on the surface of or inside the eye, damage to the lens of the eye, and inflammation or infection inside the eye. We emphasize that as the clinical investigator, you are ultimately responsible for compliance with all applicable FDA regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects, including obtaining legally effective informed consent from subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50. Your failure to obtain informed consent before conducting study-related procedures jeopardizes the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects by denying them an opportunity to fully assess the risks and benefits of their participation in the clinical investigation. This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of deficiencies with your clinical study of an investigational drug. It is your responsibility to ensure adherence to each requirement of the law and relevant FDA regulations. You should address any deficiencies and establish procedures to ensure that any ongoing or future studies comply with FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address the deficiencies noted above. Within 15 business days of your receipt of this letter, you should notify this office in writing of the actions you have taken to prevent similar violations in the future. Failure to address this matter adequately may lead to regulatory action. If you believe that you have complied with the FD&C Act and relevant regulations, please include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. Should you have any questions or concerns about this letter or the inspection, please email FDA at CDER-OSI-Communications@fda.hhs.gov.

Chang Recipient Title Owner Maui Seafood LLC 1741 S. Mojave Rd Las Vegas , NV 89104-4503 United States mauiseafoodlv@gmail.com Issuing Office: Human Foods Program United States December 10, 2025 WARNING LETTER Re: CMS Case # 715844 Dear Mr. Chang: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your ready-to-eat (RTE) seafood processing facility, located at 1741 S. Mojave Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89104-4503, from April 28 through May 16, 2025. During our inspection of your facility, the FDA investigators found serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123. Additionally, FDA collected environmental samples (i.e., swabs) from various areas in your processing facility. FDA laboratory analysis of the environmental swabs found the presence of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) , a human pathogen, in your facility. Based on FDA’s inspectional findings and the analytical results for samples collected from your production environment, we have determined your RTE whole, raw, refrigerated fishery products including tuna and salmon, are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4) in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. Furthermore, in accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a processor of fish or fishery products to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123, renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)]. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation, and the June 2022 Edition of the Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links in FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. At the conclusion of the inspection, FDA investigators issued an FDA Form 483 (FDA-483), Inspectional Observations, listing the violations found at your facility. You provided responses to the inspection on May 16 and 28, 2025, describing corrective actions taken or planned by your firm. After reviewing the inspectional findings, analytical results, and the responses that your firm provided, we are issuing this letter to advise you of FDA’s concerns and to provide detailed information describing the findings at your facility. We address your responses below. Pathogen Findings L. monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that is widespread in the environment and may be introduced into a food processing facility from raw materials, humans, or equipment. Without proper controls, L. monocytogenes can proliferate in food processing facilities where it may contaminate food. Therefore, it is essential to identify the areas of the food processing plant where this organism is able to grow and survive and to apply controls or take corrective actions as necessary to eradicate the organism. Consuming foods contaminated with L. monocytogenes can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis, which is a major public health concern due to the severity of the disease, its high case-fatality rate, its long incubation time, and its tendency to affect individuals with underlying conditions. FDA investigators collected environmental samples from your processing facility on April 30, 2025. FDA analysis of the environmental sample 1278716 confirmed that (b)(4) of (b)(4) environmental swabs were positive for L. monocytogenes . The positive findings included (b)(4) swabs collected from food contact surfaces including in the processing room on the top right of the salmon cutting board on table # (b)(4) (sub # (b)(4) ); sub # (b)(4) which was collected from the top middle of the cutting board on table # (b)(4) , metal crevice of the cutting board, and handle of hose; and on the far right and left side of the strip curtains in the staging area (subs # (b)(4) and # (b)(4) ) that were observed to come into direct contact with RTE yellowfin tuna. Additionally, L. monocytogenes was found on the inside of the (b)(4) and (b)(4) drain slots in the processing room (subs # (b)(4) and # (b)(4) ), and the center of drain # (b)(4) in the staging area (sub # (b)(4) ). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted on the above referenced L. monocytogenes isolates. The WGS analysis revealed (b)(4) strain that consisted of the (b)(4) L. monocytogenes isolates that matched (b)(4) isolate from a “smoked salmon” sample, and (b)(4) clinical isolates from 2017 and 2018, indicating that this strain can cause illness. We advised you of the importance of these WGS results via a conference call on June 4, 2025. The presence of L. monocytogenes in your facility is significant in that it demonstrates your sanitation efforts are inadequate to effectively control pathogens in your facility to prevent contamination of food or minimize its presence on food-contact surfaces. Appropriate control of L. monocytogenes in a food processing environment requires knowledge of the unique characteristics of the organism and implementing the corresponding hygienic practices necessary to control this pathogen. Once it is established in a production area, personnel or equipment can facilitate the pathogen’s movement and contamination of food-contact surfaces and finished product. It is essential to identify the harborage sites in the food processing plant and equipment where this organism is able to grow and survive and to take such corrective actions as are necessary to eradicate the organism. Our evaluation of your response to the FDA’s L. monocytogenes findings is discussed later in this letter. Additionally, FDA environmental sample 1278716 also detected Listeria innocua (L. innocua) , a non- pathogenic Listeria species, in (b)(4) environmental swabs, including on food contact surfaces. The presence of Listeria species such as L. innocua suggests that conditions are suitable for survival and/or growth of L. monocytogenes , which, as noted above, has been found in your facility. Seafood HACCP Violations (21 CFR Part 123) Your significant deviations are as follows: 1. You must monitor sanitation conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements under 21 CFR Part 117, subpart B that are appropriate to your plant and food products (21 CFR 123.11(b)). However, your firm did not monitor the following conditions and practices with sufficient frequency to ensure cGMP compliance: A. You did not ensure all food contact surfaces, including utensils, were cleaned as necessary to protect against food contamination, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(d). This is related to the condition and cleanliness of food contact surfaces, including utensils, as required by 21 CFR 123.11(b)(2). Specifically: i. On April 28 and 29, 2025, cutting boards # (b)(4) –# (b)(4) , used in the production of RTE salmon, were heavily worn and grooved. The grooves were soiled with brown, gray, and black filth. The top right corner of the salmon cutting board on table # (b)(4) was found positive for L. monocytogenes (Sample 1278716, sub # (b)(4) ). The corners of cutting boards # (b)(4) and # (b)(4) had an accumulation of brown and black filth which can be potential pathogen harborage areas. ii. On April 28, 2025, the ice scoop handle had clear tape wrapped around the handle. This tape had an accumulation of filth in the seams of each wrap. This ice scoop is used to scoop ice which has direct contact with RTE, raw seafood products, including salmon. B. You did not conduct all food manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding under conditions and controls necessary to minimize the potential growth of microorganisms, contamination of food, and deterioration of food, as required by 21 CFR 117.80(c)(2). This is related to the prevention of cross-contamination from insanitary objects to food, food packaging material, and other food contact surfaces, including utensils, gloves, and outer garments, and from raw product to cooked product, as required by 21 CFR 123.11(b)(3). Specifically: i. On April 28, 2025, an employee removed the floor drain cover in Cooler (b)(4) to scoop fish bones, blood, debris, and fish scales and fins out of the drain with their gloved hand. The employee then touched the hose to rinse the drain. Thereafter, the employee exited Cooler (b)(4) entered into Cooler (b)(4) running their gloved hands along the plastic door curtains upon exiting. The employee then re-entered Cooler (b)(4) from Cooler (b)(4) , through the plastic door curtains, and resumed cleaning the drain, without washing hands and changing gloves between these different tasks. A second employee then used their bare hands to put the drain cover back, then moved between Cooler (b)(4) and Cooler (b)(4) while touching the curtains in both directions. Thereafter, they pushed the rack of tuna loins into Cooler (b)(4) without washing their hands. ii. On April 29, 2025, an employee used their gloved hands to pick up and throw away fish trimming scraps from the floor where there was an accumulation of filthy water, fish pieces, and filth with the appearance of blood in the Staging Area. L. monocytogenes was found approximately (b)(4) feet from this area in the center of drain # (b)(4) (Sample 1278716, sub # (b)(4) ). This employee then immediately picked up a whole RTE big eye tuna product from a cardboard box and carried it into the Processing Room for processing without washing their hands and changing gloves. The FDA investigator did not observe this employee change their gloves during the entire processing shift. iii. On April 29, 2025, an employee picked up a plastic case band (which is strapped around the Styrofoam cases of fish to secure the lids) off the floor in the Processing Room. This plastic case band was approximately (b)(4) from the drain that tested positive for L. monocytogenes (Sample 1278716, sub # (b)(4) ). This employee then threw the plastic case band away and proceeded to descale RTE fresh salmon products without washing their hands and changing gloves. The salmon were processed on Table #1 which was positive for L. monocytogenes (Sample 1278716, sub # (b)(4) ). iv. On April 29–30, 2025, white cloth towels with a diluted bleach solution were used to wipe down cutting board #4 and then used to wipe down RTE fresh salmon products. The same towels were also used to wipe down finished product polystyrene boxes, creating cross-contamination between RTE products, food contact surfaces, and packaging materials. These towels were saturated by dipping them into a bleach solution of (b)(4) ppm contained in a red bucket on the bottom level of table # (b)(4) . The bleach solution was not changed during processing, and by the end of processing, the solution in the red bucket had become opaque and gray. As the towels became dirty, turning from white to gray, they were not replaced with clean towels as needed. Additionally, after reviewing the bleach solution label, there are no indications that this bleach is safe, in any dilution, for use directly on food. v. On April 28, 2025, seven seafood processing aprons were observed to be heavily soiled, including some stored outside the facility. The aprons were not cleaned and sanitized before the next processing shift on April 29, 2025, as (b)(4) of the (b)(4) soiled aprons were used by employees during processing without being cleaned before use. RTE yellowfin tuna, RTE big eye tuna, and RTE fresh salmon products came into direct contact with these (b)(4) soiled aprons during processing. vi. On April 29, 2025, fresh, unpackaged RTE yellowfin tuna and RTE big eye tuna products passed through and were in direct contact of soiled curtains into the Processing Room, which was previously touched by two employees who touched the ground without washing hands and changing gloves. L. monocytogenes was found on curtains in the staging area leading into the Processing Room (Sample 1278716, subs # (b)(4) and # (b)(4) ). vii. On April 29–30, 2025, boxes and lids used for packing RTE salmon were stored directly on the floor in the Staging Area, which was observed flooded with dirty water and located near a drain that tested positive for L. monocytogenes (Sample 1278716, sub #68). These polystyrene boxes and lids were rinsed off with water from a hose, then carried through the soiled Processing Room curtains, which tested positive for L. monocytogenes (Sample 1278716, subs # (b)(4) and # (b)(4) ), and then used to pack RTE fresh salmon products without any additional cleaning and sanitizing. viii. On April 28–30, 2025, the walls and ceilings of the Processing Room and condenser unit #3 had an accumulation of black, gray, and brown filth, including material with the appearance of dried fish residue and mold, in areas where RTE seafood products are processed directly beneath and exposed to the environmen t. C. You did not prevent drip condensate from fixtures, ducts and pipes from contaminating food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials, as required by 21 CFR 117.20(b)(4). This is related to the protection of food, food packaging material, and food contact surfaces from adulteration with condensate, as required by 21 CFR 123.11(b)(5). Specifically: i. On April 29 and 30, 2025, condensation from condenser unit # (b)(4) in Cooler (b)(4) was dripping onto boxes of RTE seafood products, including RTE fresh salmon product cases. Additionally, condensation was dripping directly onto RTE yellowfin tuna loins that were wrapped in plastic and stored on a four-level metal rack that was transported from Cooler (b)(4) into Cooler (b)(4) . Additionally, on April 30, 2025, while the same four-level metal rack was staged below the condenser, condensation was dripping onto the rack and in direct contact with partially wrapped RTE yellowfin tuna loins. ii. On April 28 and 30, 2025, condenser unit # (b)(4) was dripping onto additional RTE seafood product boxes in Cooler (b)(4) . On April 29, 2025, there was accumulated condensation on top of a box of RTE yellowfin tuna product. When the box was moved from Cooler (b)(4) to the Staging Area, an employee opened the box lid and the pooled condensate water on the lid splashed onto another box of exposed RTE yellowfin tuna. Furthermore, on April 28, 2025, condenser unit # (b)(4) had a broken and leaking outflow pipe located approximately (b)(4) feet from boxes of RTE seafood products, which was dripping onto the wall and floor of Cooler (b)(4) You explained to the FDA investigator that the condensers in Cooler (b)(4) had been dripping for approximately (b)(4) months. You indicated that you had been waiting for parts for the condenser units. Additionally, your sanitation monitoring records do not accurately reflect the conditions in the facility as evidenced by your “Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SSOP) Monitoring Record” for “GENERAL SANITATION – Daily,” between April 28–30, 2025, where the conditions described above were marked with an “s” for being satisfactory. 2. You must implement the monitoring procedures and frequency that you have listed in your HACCP Plan, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(b) and (c)(4). Specifically: A. For your HACCP Plan, “ (b)(4) ,” revised October 20, 2023, for yellowfin tuna and big eye tuna products: i. Your firm did not follow the monitoring procedures for “ (b)(4) CCP # (b)(4) ” which includes visual observation of adequacy of ice or gel packs present, verifying the internal temperature of one fish in (b)(4) % of shipping containers but not fewer than (b)(4) containers (or all containers if lot has less than (b)(4) containers) received, and digital time and temperatures of data loggers for transit periods over (b)(4) hours to control Scombrotoxin Formation and Pathogen Growth. Your “ (b)(4) ” logs do not show you are recording the adequacy of ice or gel packs for “Scombroid Species” and are only recording the internal temperature of one fish per shipment. Furthermore, you are not documenting a representative number of containers that were inspected. Your firm did not complete the “ (b)(4) ” for “Yellowfin Tuna” received on April 28, 2025, and processed on April 29, 2025. Also, adequate data logger records are not maintained to show your seafood products were continuously monitored during transits over (b)(4) hours. ii. Your firm did not follow the monitoring procedures for “ (b)(4) ” of daily cooler temperature checks on normal working days and daily review of data logger at the next day of business for the time no one was at the facility. Your firm did not record temperatures for “Cooler (b)(4) ” or meeting of critical limit for “ (b)(4) ” on your “ (b)(4) ” reviewed for December 30, 2024, through April 29, 2025. The “ (b)(4) ” had already been completed for April 30, 2025, through May 3, 2025, which were collected by FDA on April 29, 2025. Additionally, your HACCP Plan does not include a daily check of your data logger to ensure the storage temperature did not exceed (b)(4) °F, as stated in your critical limit. B. For your HACCP plan, “ (b)(4) ,” revised January 6, 2025, for fresh salmon products: i. Your firm did not follow the monitoring procedures for “ (b)(4) ” which includes verifying the internal temperature of one fish in (b)(4) % of shipping containers but not fewer than (b)(4) containers (or all containers if lot has less than (b)(4) containers) received and digital time and temperatures of data loggers for transit periods over (b)(4) hours to control Pathogen Growth and toxin formation. Your “ (b)(4) ” logs show you are only recording the internal temperature of (b)(4) fish per shipment and are not documenting a representative number of containers that were inspected. Also, adequate data logger records are not maintained to show your seafood products were continuously monitored during transit periods over (b)(4) hours. ii. Your firm did not follow the monitoring procedures for “ (b)(4) ” of daily cooler temperature checks on normal working days and “ (b)(4) .” Your firm did not record temperatures for “Cooler (b)(4) ” on your “ (b)(4) ” reviewed for December 30, 2024, through April 29, 2025. The “ (b)(4) ” had already been completed for April 30, 2025, through May 3, 2025, which were collected by FDA on April 29, 2025. Additionally, your HACCP Plan does not include a daily check of your data logger to ensure the storage temperature did not exceed (b)(4) °F, as stated in the critical limit. Additionally, you stated that your firm uses the “ (b)(4) ” to monitor fish temperature and processing room temperatures during processing of your fish products. For instance, your HACCP Plan for “ (b)(4) ”, “ (b)(4) ” step, “ (b)(4) ”, indicates your “ (b)(4) ” will be used to monitor “ (b)(4) .” You did not complete the “ (b)(4) ” form during the processing of your fish products on April 23-26, 2025. 3. You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s HACCP plan for “ (b)(4) ,” revised January 7, 2025, lists a critical limit of (b)(4) °F, which, at the “ (b)(4) ” and “ (b)(4) ” critical control points, is not adequate to control Clostridium botulinum growth and toxin formation. Your HACCP plan states (b)(4) . Your receiving and finished product storage critical limits should ensure that these products are maintained below 38°F (3.3°C) throughout transit and stored below 38°F (3.3°C). 4. You must verify that your HACCP plan is adequate to control food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, and the plan is being effectively implemented. However, your firm did not review consumer complaints to determine whether they relate to the performance of critical control points or reveal the existence of unidentified critical control points to comply with 21 CFR 123.8(a)(2)(i). Additionally, when a deviation occurs, you are to ensure no product enters commerce that is either injurious to health or is otherwise adulterated and correct the cause of the deviation to comply with 21 CFR 123.7(b). During the inspection, you explained your “ (b)(4) ” log is also your log of complaints. During a review of your “ (b)(4) ” log, it was observed that between January 2, 2025 and April 29, 2025, you documented (b)(4) consumer complaints about your fish products which included (b)(4) complaints for tuna with returns related to bad quality, color changes, and brown color, but you did not document any corrective actions such as a food safety evaluation or the disposition of the product. Further, you explained that some products may be re-sold. For example, the complaints about your tuna indicate (b)(4) . We evaluated your May 16 and 28, 2025 responses, which included a repair estimate, and you explained that you (b)(4) . You also stated that you (b)(4) .” You further explained that on May 22, 2025, you were (b)(4) .” We acknowledge that after Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) issued a cease-and-desist order on May 16, 2025, they conducted a follow-up inspection on May 22, 2025. According to the SNHD report, your facility made major construction repairs, and you conducted Listeria swabbing on all cutting boards, all prep tables, processing room wall, hand wash sink, 3-compartment sink, processing room drains and electrical switches, and warehouse areas including curtains and storage shelves. The report indicated that all test results were negative. As a result of their inspection, SNHD approved your facility to reopen. While we acknowledge you were approved to reopen your facility by SNHD, based on the information you have provided, FDA is unable to evaluate if you are adequately controlling L. monocytogenes and if you are monitoring the sanitary conditions and practices in your facility. We continue to be concerned about your ability to maintain a sanitary environment, as you did not provide supporting documentation to demonstrate how you plan to prevent future reoccurrence of Listeria contamination including L. monocytogenes , and how you will ensure a sanitary environment is maintained. We recommend you consider taking additional actions, such as developing an environmental monitoring procedure, root cause analysis to determine the cause(s) of the Listeria findings and providing analytical results for environmental sample testing. We also recommend that you provide us with a copy of records of the cleaning and sanitizing of the facility with details on the procedures used (including the chemicals and method used, by whom, and when), a new cleaning and sanitizing procedure, standard sanitation operating procedures (SSOPs) and monitoring logs to demonstrate implementation of the SSOPs, and employee training records. Additionally, your response did not include a revised HACCP plan and critical control point monitoring records. The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including applicable FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, injunction, or administrative action for suspension of food facility registration if criteria and conditions warrant. Please notify FDA in writing within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps and corrections you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). In addition, we reviewed your firm’s drug listing submissions in FDA’s electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) and found that your firm has not fulfilled its drug listing obligations under 510(j) of the FD&C Act, U.S.C. 360(j), and 21 CFR 207, which is prohibited under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(p). We reviewed your September 8, 2025, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following. CGMP Violations 1. Your firm failed to establish and follow appropriate written procedures that are designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization processes. Your firm also failed to perform operations within specifically defined areas of adequate size and to have separate or defined areas or such other control systems necessary to prevent contamination or mix-ups in aseptic processing areas (21 CFR 211.113(b) and 211.42(c)(10)). You are a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) for an over-the-counter (OTC) (b)(4) drug product for the drug product owner, (b)(4) . You manufacture this (b)(4) drug product without adequate facility design, controls, and procedures to ensure sterility of the containers/closures and finished drug product. Your firm neither aseptically processed nor terminally sterilized your product. If (b)(4) drugs are not sterile, they pose an unacceptable risk to patients, including infection and potential for (b)(4) . During the inspection, you acknowledged you lack an adequate understanding of CGMP and the requirements for manufacturing (b)(4) drug products. Our investigators observed that your facility lacked classified cleanrooms for production, as well as ISO 5 conditions for aseptic filling and sealing. Furthermore, your manufacturing facility lacks appropriate equipment and practices, including environmental controls to ensure your (b)(4) drug product is sterile. Your drug products intended to be sterile are at risk of contamination due to the insanitary conditions observed at your facility. This includes the condition of the production tank, filling lines lying on an unclean floor made of a rough, porous surface (e.g., concrete) in an open area, lack of appropriate sanitary fittings, and the general overall poor conditions of the facility for manufacturing drug products intended to be sterile. Additionally, investigators observed stagnant (b)(4) in contact with distribution and sampling equipment, including hoses that dispense (b)(4) used for drug product formulation. Your response is inadequate because you do not provide an adequate plan for corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) for manufacturing (b)(4) drug products intended to be sterile. Your response lacks an appropriate action plan to ensure sterility of the product. Sterilization, aseptic filling, and closing operations must all be appropriately designed, qualified, and executed under appropriate conditions, including filling and sealing in a high-quality clean environment. It should also be noted that, whenever feasible, terminal sterilization should be used to render products sterile. See FDA’s guidance document Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing—Current Good Manufacturing Practice to help you meet the CGMP requirements when manufacturing sterile drugs using aseptic processing at https://www.fda.gov/media/71026/download. In response to this letter, provide: Comprehensive risk assessment of all contamination hazards with respect to your aseptic processes, equipment, and facilities, including an independent assessment that includes, but is not limited to: o All human interactions within the ISO 5 area o Equipment placement and ergonomics o Air quality in the ISO 5 area and surrounding room o Facility layout o Personnel Flows and Material Flows (throughout all rooms used to conduct and support sterile operations) A detailed remediation plan with timelines to address the findings of the contamination hazards risk assessment. Describe specific tangible improvements to be made to aseptic processing operation design and control. An assessment of the potential for terminal sterilization of your (b)(4) drug products. 2. Your firm failed to use equipment in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of drug products that is of appropriate design, adequate size, and suitably located to facilitate operations for its intended use and for its cleaning and maintenance. Your firm also failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess. Additionally, your firm also failed to clean, maintain, and, as appropriate for the nature of the drug, sanitize and/or sterilize equipment and utensils at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug product beyond the official or other established requirements. (21 CFR 211.63 and 211.100(a) and 211.67(a)). Inadequate Equipment You use (b)(4) as a component to manufacture your sterile and non-sterile OTC drug products. Your (b)(4) system is inadequately designed and maintained for its intended use. For example, your ambient non-circulating (b)(4) system included dead legs which could foster the development of biofilms. When not in use, stagnant (b)(4) remained in the sampling hose and distribution system. You use (b)(4) from this system to manufacture your drug products. In your response, you state that you removed the dead legs and revised your procedure for hose storage. You also state that you will continuously operate your (b)(4) system, record maintenance events, and increase sampling frequency. Your response is inadequate because you failed to replace the unsuitable (b)(4) system observed during the inspection with a new appropriately designed system. You also failed to provide corresponding plans for system validation. Additionally, you lack plans for maintenance, control, and appropriate testing and monitoring for (b)(4) , as well as appropriate microbiological tests. The (b)(4) system must be adequately designed for its intended use and properly maintained and controlled. It is essential that (b)(4) is routinely tested to ensure ongoing conformance with appropriate chemical and microbiological attributes. Lack of process validation In addition to inadequate facility and process design, you lacked adequate qualification of equipment and validation of processes used to manufacture your drug products. The “current validated” sterilization manufacturing process provided in your response is fundamentally flawed as evidenced by: insanitary conditions in your facility; use of a (b)(4) not sufficient for sterile (b)(4) ; reliance on a manually intensive process; lack of batch sterility testing (your firm performed “CFU testing”). Also, you lacked other basic elements of a reliable sterile manufacturing operation needed to support a validated process. Process validation evaluates the soundness of design and state of control of a process throughout its lifecycle. Each significant stage of a manufacturing process must be designed appropriately to ensure the quality of raw material inputs, in-process materials, and finished drugs. Process qualification studies determine whether an initial state of control has been established. Successful process qualification studies are necessary before commercial distribution. Thereafter, ongoing vigilant oversight of process performance and product quality are necessary to ensure that you maintain a stable manufacturing operation throughout the product lifecycle. See FDA’s guidance document Process Validation: General Principles and Practices for general principles and approaches that FDA considers appropriate elements of process validation, at https://www.fda.gov/media/71021/download. Lack of cleaning validation You manufacture sterile and non-sterile OTC drug products and cosmetics on non-dedicated manufacturing equipment in a shared area. You failed to conduct cleaning validation studies to demonstrate that your cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization practices, as applicable, are adequate to remove contaminants and residues from your drug product manufacturing equipment. Your procedure for cleaning production equipment used to manufacture (b)(4) drug products, “Special Cleaning Procedure For Other Equipment,” relies on (b)(4) (e.g., (b)(4) ) as the “sterilization” agent. While (b)(4) can be an effective disinfectant, your procedure lacks critical elements such as validated contact times, concentration verification, residue removal, and demonstration that the cleaning process consistently achieves the sterility assurance levels required for sterile drug products. Inadequate removal of active ingredients and residues from manufacturing equipment during cleaning can result in cross-contamination of the drug products. In response to this letter, provide: Your CAPA plan to implement routine, vigilant operations management oversight of facilities and equipment. This plan should ensure, among other things, prompt detection of equipment/facilities performance issues, effective execution of repairs, adherence to appropriate preventive maintenance schedules, timely technological upgrades to the equipment/facility infrastructure, and improved systems for ongoing management review. A comprehensive remediation plan for the design, control, and maintenance of the (b)(4) system. Validation report for the (b)(4) system obtained after an appropriately designed system has been installed. Include the system validation protocol, the complete test results, and the final validation report. Your total microbial count limits to monitor whether this system is producing (b)(4) suitable for the intended uses for each of your products. Also, explain whether you intend to conduct endotoxin testing. A detailed risk assessment addressing the potential effects of the observed (b)(4) system failures on the quality of all drug product batches currently in U.S. distribution or within expiry. Specify actions that you will take in response to the risk assessment, such as customer notifications and product recalls. A detailed summary of your validation program for ensuring a state of control throughout the product lifecycle, along with associated procedures. Describe your program for process performance qualification, and ongoing monitoring of both intra-batch and inter-batch variation to ensure a continuing state of control. A timeline for performing appropriate process performance qualification (PPQ) for each of your marketed drug products. Also provide a risk assessment and any follow up actions to be taken for the distributed drug products produced without performing any process validation studies. Process performance protocol(s), and written procedures for qualification of equipment and facilities. A detailed program for designing, validating, maintaining, controlling and monitoring each of your manufacturing processes that includes vigilant monitoring of intra-batch and inter-batch variation to ensure an ongoing state of control. Also, include your program for qualification of your equipment and facility. A CAPA plan, based on the retrospective assessment of your cleaning and disinfection program, that includes appropriate remediations to your cleaning and disinfection processes and practices, and timelines for completion. Provide a detailed summary of vulnerabilities in your process for lifecycle management of equipment cleaning and disinfection. Describe improvements to your cleaning and disinfection program, including enhancements to cleaning effectiveness; improved ongoing verification of proper cleaning and disinfection execution for all products and equipment; and all other needed remediations. Appropriate improvements to your cleaning validation program, with special emphasis on incorporating conditions identified as worst case in your drug manufacturing operation. This should include but not be limited to identification and evaluation of all worst-case: o drugs with higher toxicities o drugs with higher drug potencies o drugs of lower solubility in their cleaning solvents o drugs with characteristics that make them difficult to clean o swabbing locations for areas that are most difficult to clean o maximum hold times before cleaning In addition, describe the steps that must be taken in your change management system before introduction of new manufacturing equipment or a new product. A summary of updated SOPs that ensure an appropriate program is in place for verification and validation of cleaning procedures for products, processes, and equipment. 3. Your firm failed to have, for each batch of drug product, appropriate laboratory determination of satisfactory conformance to final specifications for the drug product, including the identity and strength of each active ingredient, prior to release. Your firm failed to conduct, for each batch of drug product, appropriate laboratory testing, as necessary, required to be free of objectionable microorganisms. Additionally, your firm failed to conduct appropriate laboratory testing to determine whether each batch of drug product purporting to be sterile and pyrogen-free conforms to such requirements (21 CFR 211.165(a) and 211.165(b) and 211.167(a)). You failed to conduct adequate release testing of all your drug products. For example: You did not conduct appropriate laboratory testing, including sterility testing, for each batch of (b)(4) drug product that is required to be sterile. You did not conduct appropriate laboratory testing of each batch of drug product, such as (b)(4) , required to be free of objectionable microorganisms. In your response, you specify the microbiological media lots used to perform testing are validated. Your response is inadequate. For example, media used, sample size, incubation time and temperatures, and other elements of your test methods are inappropriate. You also do not provide sufficient details as to how you will ensure that your laboratory or your contract testing laboratories will perform adequate release testing on all OTC finished drug products. In addition to compendial methods, additional batch testing may be necessary to fully identify microbes that, based on the intended use of your non-sterile products, may be objectionable. Moreover, you failed to perform appropriate sterility testing on your (b)(4) drug products prior to batch release. It is essential that you conduct sterility testing on (b)(4) drug products prior to making batch disposition decisions. Additionally, you do not consider a risk assessment or retrospective review of products that have been released without appropriate testing. Full release testing, including for identity, strength, and purity, must be performed prior to batch release and distribution. Without appropriate testing, you do not have adequate scientific evidence to ensure that your drug products conform to established specifications before release. In response to this letter, provide: A comprehensive independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system. A list of chemical and microbial specifications, including test methods, used to analyze each batch of your drug products before a batch disposition decision. o An action plan and timelines for conducting full chemical and microbiological testing of retain samples to determine the quality of all batches of drug product distributed to the United States that are within expiry as of the date of this letter. o A summary of all results obtained from testing retain samples from each batch. If such testing reveals substandard quality drug products, take rapid corrective actions, such as notifying customers and product recalls. Drug Listing Violations Section 510(j) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360(j), and 21 CFR Part 207 set forth the requirements for the listing of drugs. Under section 510(j)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 207.41(a), a registrant must list each drug that it manufactures for commercial distribution. Your firm failed to provide listing information for the drug “ (b)(4) Solution.” Therefore, your firm has failed to provide listing information for a drug in accordance with 510(j) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360(j), which is prohibited under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(p). Complete, accurate, and up-to-date establishment registration and drug listing information is essential to promote and protect patient safety. FDA relies on establishment registration and drug listing information for several key programs, including drug establishment inspections, supply chain security, and post-market surveillance. Establishment registration and drug listing information is also widely used outside FDA for purposes such as electronic prescribing and electronic health records, insurance reimbursement, and patient education. It is your responsibility to ensure that all drugs manufactured at your establishment comply with all establishment registration and drug listing requirements under section 510 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360, 21 CFR Part 207, and all other applicable FDA regulations. Registration and listing information and instructions on how to properly register an establishment or submit drug listings can be found at Electronic Drug Registration and Listing Instructions. Drug Recall and Suspended Distribution On November 4, 2025, FDA held a teleconference with you. We recommended you remove any batches of OTC (b)(4) solution (e.g., (b)(4) Solution) currently in distribution and within expiry from the U.S. market. We also recommended you consider ceasing further distribution. Your firm erroneously indicated that your (b)(4) solution is not a drug product. However, be advised that this (b)(4) and other drug products that your firm has manufactured are all subject to CGMP requirements. The (b)(4) solutions manufactured by your firm are distributed by (b)(4) . On (b)(4) , your customer (b)(4) notified FDA that it suspended distribution of (b)(4) on (b)(4) . On (b)(4) initiated a voluntary recall of all batches of (b)(4) within expiry. In response to this letter, clarify whether you intend to continue manufacturing (b)(4) drugs required to be sterile for the U.S. market at this facility. You are responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure your firm is capable of ongoing CGMP compliance. In your response, provide a summary of your remediations to demonstrate that you have appropriately completed all CAPA. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, you should engage a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to evaluate your operations and to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. The qualified consultant should also perform a comprehensive six-system audit 1 of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status with FDA. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. Cosmetics Manufactured for Distribution in the United States In addition, some of the products you manufacture may be regulated as cosmetics, as defined in section 201(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(i)]. Any cosmetics you manufacture must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, including the FD&C Act. We note that under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)], it is a prohibited act to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded. We also note that the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA) provides new requirements with which facilities that manufacture cosmetic products must comply. You may find the FD&C Act, MoCRA, and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s website at www.fda.gov. Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address this matter may result in regulatory or legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Unresolved violations may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts. Failure to address violations may also cause FDA to withhold issuance of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to address any violations. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov.

FDA has reviewed your company’s website at https://prodxhealth.com (last visited February 2026) and your firm’s February 3, 2026 response to previous FDA correspondence. Based on our review of these materials, your firm offers its sample self-collection kits for delivery to individuals and intends for these individuals to use the kits to self-collect serological samples and ship those samples to laboratories for HIV testing. FDA has determined that your sample self-collection kits are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(f)(1)(B) because they do not have an approved premarket approval application (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360j(g). Your sample self-collection kits are also misbranded under section 502(o) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(o), because notification of the intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution has not been provided to the Agency, as required by section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360(k). FDA has not authorized your firm’s sample self-collection kits for use in HIV serological diagnostic testing. Notably, this letter focuses on your sample self-collection kits and is not intended to be a comprehensive list of potential issues with your firm’s products. Without appropriate testing, data review, and marketing authorization, there is a lack of assurance of the safety and effectiveness of your sample self-collection kits. Self-collection raises several issues of importance, including, for example, whether the user can safely and properly collect the specimen, if the sample has been properly shipped, and if there is adequate stability of the specimen given the time lapse between collection and testing and the potential impact of shipping conditions. We note that there are FDA-approved over-the-counter HIV self-tests that can help meet the needs of individuals who wish to test themselves at home or who are unable to access other testing options. The violations cited in this letter are not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that may exist in connection with your products. FDA requests that your firm immediately cease any activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of your sample self-collection kits. Your firm should take prompt action to address the violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. If you believe that your firm’s sample self-collection kits are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration in your response to this letter. Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify FDA in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct any violations. Your response should include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations as well as related documentation. If you cannot complete all corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the date by which you will complete the correction.

Haas Recipient Title Medical Director Conceive Fertility Center 7515 Greenville Ave Ste 1030 Dallas , TX 75231 United States drhaas@cfcivf.com Issuing Office: Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) United States WARNING LETTER CBER 26-722459 January 27, 2026 Dear Dr. Haas: During an inspection of your firm, Conceive Fertility Center located at 7515 Greenville Ave Ste 1030, Dallas, TX 75231, conducted between June 6, 2025, and June 13, 2025, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documented significant violations from the regulations for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Part 1271 [21 CFR 1271] and issued under the authority of Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. § 264]. The observations documented on the Form FDA-483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483), were presented to and discussed with you at the conclusion of the inspection, and following FDA’s review, your violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Failure to screen a donor of reproductive cells or tissue by reviewing the donor’s relevant medical records for risk factors for and clinical evidence of relevant communicable disease agents and diseases [21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1)]. Your firm’s Donor Medical History Interview Form is used as a relevant medical record to determine donor eligibility. From January 1, 2022, through June 12, 2025, your firm used this form to screen approximately 61 anonymous oocyte donors, 40 directed oocyte donors, and 79 directed semen donors. However, your form does not include screening for all conditions and/or behaviors that increase a donor’s relevant communicable disease risk. The form is missing questions, timeframes, and/or deferral periods to assess a donor’s relevant communicable disease risk: a. Question 5 states, “Have you had sex in the preceding 12 months with any person described in the previous 4 items in this section or with any person known or suspected to have HIV infection, clinically active hepatitis B infection, or hepatitis C infection?” To adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of these diseases, the question needs to ask about hepatitis B infection (both active and inactive) and clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection. b. Question 8 states, “Have you had close contact within 12 months preceding donation with another person having clinically active viral hepatitis (e.g., living in the same household, where sharing of kitchen and bathroom facilities occurs regularly)?” The question needs to ask whether persons have lived with (resided in the same dwelling) another person who has hepatitis B or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection in the preceding 12 months. c. Question 9 states, “Have you had a tattoo or body piercing in the last 12 months in which instruments were shared?” The question needs to also ask whether sterile procedures were not used. d. Persons who have had a medical diagnosis or suspicion of West Nile Virus (based on symptoms and/or laboratory results or confirmed WNV viremia) need to be deferred for 120 days following diagnosis or onset of illness, whichever is later. You do not include “suspicion” in your form or equivalent terminology to adequately screen for this illness. e. Your form fails to screen for persons who have tested positive or reactive for WNV infection using an FDA-licensed or investigational WNV NAT donor screening test in the preceding 120 days. f. Your form fails to screen for persons who have been treated for or had syphilis within the preceding 12 months. g. Your form fails to adequately screen for persons who are current or former U.S. military members, civilian military employees, or dependents of a military member or civilian employee who resided at U.S. military bases in Northern Europe (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) for 6 months or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1990, or elsewhere in Europe (Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Italy) for 6 months or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1996. Without “cumulatively” or similar language the question is under-inclusive. h. Your form fails to screen for persons who have received any transfusion of blood or blood components in France between 1980 and the present. 2) Failure to determine as ineligible a donor who is identified as having a risk factor for, or clinical evidence of, any of the relevant communicable disease agents or diseases for which screening is required under 21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1), (b), or (c) [21 CFR 1271.75(d)]. For example: a. Directed semen donor (b)(6) answered \"yes\" to Question #26 on the Spanish version of the Donor Medical History Interview Form, “Have you lived cumulatively for 5 years or more in Europe from 1980 until the present (note this criterion includes time spent in the U.K. from 1980 through 1996?\" Donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on April 30, 2025. b. Directed semen donor (b)(6) answered \"yes\" to Question #1 on the Donor Medical History Interview Form, \"(Men Only) Have you had sex with another man in the preceding five years?\" Donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on April 12, 2024. 3) Failure to determine whether a donor is eligible based upon the results of donor screening in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.75 and donor testing in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.80 and 21 CFR 1271.85 [21 CFR 1271.50(a)]. The eligibility of donors was determined and documented prior to the receipt of the results of donor testing for relevant communicable disease agents. For example: a. Directed oocyte donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on February 20, 2025, but the results of donor testing were not received until February 22, 2025. b. Anonymous oocyte donor (b)(6) , Donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on September 28, 2024, but the results of donor testing were not received until September 30, 2024. 4) Failure to collect a donor specimen for testing for relevant communicable diseases at the time of recovery of cells or tissue from the donor; or up to seven days before or after recovery [21 CFR 1271.80(b)]. For example, a. Semen was collected from directed donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) . However, a specimen for communicable disease testing was collected from the donor on (b)(6) . Donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on December 19, 2024. b. Semen was collected from directed donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) . However, a specimen for communicable disease testing was collected from the donor on (b)(6) . Donor (b)(6) was determined “ineligible” on October 2, 2023. 5) Failure to include in the summary of records a statement noting the reason(s) for the determination of ineligibility in the case of an HCT/P from a donor who is ineligible based on screening and released under 21 CFR 1271.65(b) [21 CFR 1271.55(b)(4)]. For example, a review of the donor records collected during the inspection, revealed that at least 21 directed semen donors were determined “ineligible”, however, the summary of records does not state the reason for the determination of ineligibility. 6) Failure of the summary of records, required under 1271.55(a)(3), to contain a listing and interpretation of the results of all communicable disease tests performed [21 CFR 1271.55(b)(2)]. For example, your SUMMARY OFRECORDS/DONOR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION- DONOR form does not include a listing and interpretation of the results of specific testing for anti-HIV-1,anti-HIV-2, HIV-1 NAT, HBV NAT, HCV NAT, WNV NAT, anti-HTLV I/II, and anti-CMV (total IgG and IgM). 7) Failure to establish and maintain procedures for all steps performed in testing, screening, determining donor eligibility, and complying with all other requirements of Subpart C “Donor Eligibility” in 21 CFR Part 1271.45-1271.90.“Establish and maintain” means define, document, and implement; then follow, review, and as needed, revise on an ongoing basis [21 CFR 1271.47(a)]. For example, your Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Office Screening of Patients Donating Human Cells (Oocytes and Sperm) , does not contain donor eligibility procedures describing requirements that must be met to determine a donor as eligible or ineligible. We note that this is a repeat violation that was discussed with your firm during the FDA inspection conducted between October13, 2021, and October 15, 2021. The violations identified above are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure that your establishment complies with all applicable federal regulations. You are responsible for reviewing your firm’s operations, including firms within the same organization, as a whole to ensure that you are in compliance with the law. We acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated June 24, 2025, providing a response to FDA’s inspectional observations. We have reviewed your response, and we have determined that the response is inadequate to address our concerns. We have the following comments regarding your FDA 483 response: 1) Regarding Observation 2, your response did not address whether there are HCT/Ps still in storage from donors that were not screened and/or tested in accordance with 21 CFR 1271. 2) Regarding Observation 3, we acknowledge the implementation of your new SOP, Screening and Eligibility Determination for Sperm Donors Regarding Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Effective Date: 06/17/2025). However, the SOP does not include how the CMV test results will be communicated to the physician responsible for accepting the HCT/P so that they may rely on the information to make informed decisions about the use of an HCT/P in a particular recipient's situation. 3) Regarding Observation 4, we acknowledge your revision to SOP, Office Screening of Patients Donating Human Cells (Oocytes and Sperm) (Revised Date: 06/24/2025), to include requirements that must be met to determine a donor as eligible or ineligible and departures from procedures. Our review of your procedure found the following: a. Your procedure does not specify anti-HBc and WNV NAT as required testing. b. Section 3, “Medical History Evaluation,” states that if donors respond “yes” to a question on your Donor Medical History Interview Form (DMHIF), “Further investigation with laboratory testing may be needed before the physician determines the patient can be considered eligible to donate tissue.” Section 6, “Donor Eligibility Determination,” states that if donors respond “yes” to a question on your DMHIF, and “… it is determined that the risk of a communicable disease is negligible, the donor may still pass.” In accordance with 21 CFR 1271.75(d)(1), a donor who is identified as having a risk factor for or clinical evidence of any of the relevant communicable disease agents or diseases for which screening is required under paragraphs (a)(1), (b), or (c) must be determined to be ineligible. This applies to both anonymous and directed donors. c. Section 6, “Donor Eligibility Determination,” regarding test results states, “If any of the testing is positive, a provider must determine if there is an active infection (donor would be ineligible in that case), or if there is a previously treated infection that continues to show positive for the test in question.” In accordance with 21 CFR 1271.80(d)(1), a donor whose specimen tests reactive on a screening test for a communicable disease agent in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.85, except for a donor whose specimen tests reactive on a non-treponemal screening test for syphilis and negative on a specific treponemal confirmatory test, must be determined to be ineligible. This applies to both anonymous and directed donors. d. Section 6, “Donor Eligibility Determination,” allows for donors who test reactive for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhea to be reconsidered with a negative test-of-cure and a 3-month waiting period after completion of treatment. However, evidence needs to be presented that the treatment occurred more than 12 months ago and was successful. Finally, we have the following additional comments regarding your firm's operations: Section 6 of your SOP, Office Screening of Patients Donating Human Cells (Oocytes and Sperm) (Revised Date: 06/24/2025), states that the “Summary of Records/Donor Eligibility Determination Form” is completed with the “Eligible” or “Ineligible” status. There are two locations on this form where your firm documents and dates the donor eligibility determination. The dates do not match for multiple donors. Sections III (ELIGIBILITY) and IV (LABELING) of the “Summary of Records/Donor Eligibility Determination Form” includes checkboxes for “ELIGIBLE.” However, “ELIGIBLE” was also checked under Section IV for several directed donors who were determined “INELIGIBLE” under Section III. In addition, the symbols listed in Section IV do not include the Biohazard legend shown in 21 CFR 1271.3(h). Additional information regarding the regulation of HCT/Ps is available at: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/tissue-tissue-products https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/biologics-guidances/tissue-guidances FDA Workshop for the Reproductive Tissue Industry - Sept 29 and Oct 1, 2020 - 09/29/2020 - 10/01/2020 | FDA Please note that if you still have oocytes and/or semen in storage from donors whose screening and/or testing was not completed in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1271, FDA considers the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these donors. For example, this includes donors who were not appropriately tested for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases and/or who were not appropriately screened for relevant communicable disease risk factors which includes using previous versions of donor history questionnaires (e.g., non-English versions) that did not screen for all conditions and/or behaviors that increase a donor’s relevant communicable disease risk. Therefore, as required by 21 CFR 1271.60(a), you must keep these HCT/Ps in quarantine. Should the need arise in the future to remove any of these HCT/Ps from quarantine, either for use in your own establishment or for transport to another establishment, you may request an exemption or alternative from a requirement in Subpart C, 21 CFR Part 1271, as specified in 21 CFR 1271.155.

Ramirez, MD, FACOG Recipient Title Executive Medical Director Central Coast Multispecialty Medical Group, Inc. 9833 Blue Larkspur Ln Monterey , CA 93940 United States ejrmd@montereybayivf.com Issuing Office: Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) United States WARNING LETTER CBER 26-722521 January 29, 2026 Dear Dr. Ramirez: During an inspection of your firm, Central Coast Multispecialty Medical Group, Inc., located at 9833 Blue Larkspur Lane, Monterey, CA, conducted between May 13, 2025, and May 16, 2025, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documented significant violations from the regulations for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Part 1271 [21 CFR 1271] and issued under the authority of Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. § 264]. The observations documented on the Form FDA-483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483), were presented to and discussed with you at the conclusion of the inspection, and following FDA’s review, your violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Failure to screen a donor of reproductive cells or tissue by reviewing the donor’srelevant medical records for risk factors for, and clinical evidence of, relevantcommunicable disease agents and diseases [21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1)]. Your firm’sDonor Eligibility Questionnaire and Donor Medical History Interview Form areused as relevant medical records to determine donor eligibility. However, yourforms do not include screening for all conditions and/or behaviors that increase adonor’s relevant communicable disease risk. For example, the Donor EligibilityQuestionnaire form submitted with your FDA 483 response is missing questions,timeframes, and/or deferral periods to assess a donor’s relevant communicabledisease risk for the following: a. Question 5 fails to screen for persons who have had sex in the preceding 12 months with any person who has had sex with a man who has had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years, persons with hepatitis B infection (both active and inactive) or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection , persons who have injected drugs for a non-medical reason in the preceding 5 years, including intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections, and persons who have engaged in sex in exchange for money or drugs in the preceding 5 years. b. Question 8 states, “Have you within the past 12 months of donation undergone tattoing [sic], ear piercing, or body piercing in which shared instruments are known to have been used.” The question needs to also ask whether sterile procedures were not used. c. Question 11 states, “Have you had a recent smallpox vaccination (vaccinia virus) in the last 21 days?” To adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of this disease, the question needs to ask about smallpox vaccination (vaccinia virus) in the preceding 8 weeks . d. Question 13 states, “Have you had a medical diagnosis of West Nile Virus Infection within the last 120 days (including diagnosis based on symptoms and laboratory results, or confirmed WNV viremia)?” You do not include “suspicion” in your form or equivalent terminology to adequately screen for this illness. e. Your form fails to adequately screen for persons who have spent 3 months or more cumulatively in the UK between 1980 and 1996. Without “cumulatively” or similar language the question is under-inclusive. f. Your form fails to adequately screen for persons who are current or former U.S. military members, civilian military employees, or dependents of a military member or civilian employee who resided at U.S. military bases in Northern Europe (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) for 6 months or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1990, or elsewhere in Europe (Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Italy) for 6 months or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1996. Without “cumulatively” or similar language the question is under-inclusive. g. Your form fails to screen for persons who spent 5 years or more cumulatively in Europe from 1980 until the present (note this criterion includes time spent in the U.K. from 1980 through 1996). h. Your question 29 states, “Have you had close contact within 12 months preceding donation with another person having clinically active viral hepatitis?” To adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of this disease, the question needs to also ask about persons who have lived with (resided in the same dwelling) another person who has hepatitis B or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection in the preceding 12 months. i. Your form fails to screen for persons who have tested positive or reactive for WNV infection using an FDA-licensed or investigational WNV NAT donor screening test in the preceding 120 days. 2) Failure to determine as ineligible a donor who is identified as having a risk factor for, or clinical evidence of, any of the relevant communicable disease agents or diseases for which screening is required under 21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1), (b), or (c) [21 CFR 1271.75(d)]. For example, directed semen donor (b)(6) answered \"yes\" to question 1 on your Donor Medical History Interview Form , “(Men only) Have you had sex with another man in the preceding five years?” Donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on May 9, 2025. 3) Failure to determine whether a donor is eligible based upon the results of donor screening in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.75 and donor testing in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.80 and 21 CFR 1271.85 [21 CFR 1271.50(a)]. The eligibility of donor (b)(6) was determined and documented prior to the receipt of the results of donor testing for relevant communicable disease agents. For example, directed semen donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on May 9, 2025, but the results of donor testing for Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhea , and HIV/HCV/HBV NAT were not received until May 10, 2025. The violations identified above are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure that your establishment complies with all applicable federal regulations. You are responsible for reviewing your firm’s operations, including firms within the same organization, as a whole to ensure that you are in compliance with the law. Additional information regarding the regulation of HCT/Ps is available at: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/tissue-tissue-products https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/biologics-guidances/tissue-guidances FDA Workshop for the Reproductive Tissue Industry - Sept 29 and Oct 1, 2020 - 09/29/2020 - 10/01/2020 | FDA We acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated May 28, 2025, providing a response to the FDA’s inspectional observations. We have reviewed your response, and we have determined that the response is inadequate to address our concerns. We have the following comments regarding your FDA 483 response: 1) We acknowledge the revisions made to your Donor Eligibility Questionnaire submitted with your response. However, our review of this questionnaire identified additional deficiencies as outlined in this letter. 2) Regarding Observations 1 and 2, your response does not address the required labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 1271.65(b)(2). All donors, except as provided under 21 CFR 1271.90, are required to be screened by reviewing the donor’s relevant medical records for risk factors for, and clinical evidence of, relevant communicable disease agents and diseases (21 CFR 1271.75(a)) and tested for relevant communicable diseases (21 CFR 1271.80). Please note, an HCT/P from a donor who has been determined to be ineligible, based on the results of required testing and/or screening, is not prohibited by Subpart C from use for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer if the HCT/P consists of reproductive cells or tissue from a directed reproductive donor as defined in 21 CFR 1271.3(l). 3) Regarding Observation 3, you stated “The policies and procedures that are in place in regards to our treatment of Donor patients is verbally transmitted through training and continuous guidance, and we do not rely on the Donor policy book for reference or use. It is merely there to be compliant.” Please be advised, you must establish and maintain procedures for all steps that you perform in testing, screening, determining donor eligibility, and complying with all other requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271, Subpart C. Establish and maintain means define, document (in writing or electronically), and implement; then follow, review, and as needed, revise on an ongoing basis. Please note that if you still have oocytes and/or semen in storage from donors whose screening and/or testing was not completed in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1271, FDA considers the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these donors. For example, this includes donors who were not appropriately tested for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases and/or who were not appropriately screened for relevant communicable disease risk factors which includes using previous versions of donor history questionnaires that did not screen for all conditions and/or behaviors that increase a donor’s relevant communicable disease risk. Therefore, as required by 21 CFR 1271.60(a), you must keep these HCT/Ps in quarantine. Should the need arise in the future to remove any of these HCT/Ps from quarantine, either for use in your own establishment or for transport to another establishment, you may request an exemption or alternative from a requirement in Subpart C, 21 CFR Part 1271, as specified in 21 CFR 1271.155. Additional information can be found at Exemptions and Alternatives | FDA. The email address for submissions is HCTPExemptions@fda.hhs.gov. Please note that 21 CFR 1271.155 requires that you provide justification for use of HCT/Ps from these donors, as well as information on how you have mitigated the risk consistent with the goals of protecting the public health and/or preventing the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. Before any of these HCT/Ps can be removed from quarantine, the request must be granted by FDA. If you still have embryos in storage for which the donor eligibility requirements under 21 CFR 1271, Subpart C are not met, please note that FDA considers the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these donors.

Should the need arise in the future to remove any of these HCT/Ps from quarantine, either for use in your own establishment or for transport to another establishment, you may release these HCT/Ps from quarantine [21 CFR 1271.90(b)] provided they are labeled in accordance with the applicable regulations at 21 CFR 1271.90(c). You should take prompt action to correct any violations addressed in this letter and prevent their recurrence. Failure to promptly correct any violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by FDA without further notice. We request that you respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter, outlining the specific steps you have taken or plan to take to correct any violations, including an explanation of how you plan to prevent them, or similar violations, from occurring again.

The observations documented on the Form FDA-483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483), were presented to and discussed with you at the conclusion of the inspection, and following FDA’s review, your violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Failure to test a specimen from an anonymous or directed reproductive donor of cells or tissue, whether viable or non-viable, for evidence of infection due to relevant communicable disease agents [21 CFR 1271.85(a)]. For example: a. Semen was collected from directed donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) . However, the donor was not tested for human immunodeficiency virus, type-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) by the nucleic acid test (NAT) method, or hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Directed semen donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on July 12, 2024. b. Semen was collected from directed donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) . However, the donor was not tested for West Nile Virus (WNV). Directed semen donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on July 12, 2024. 2) Failure to test a specimen from a donor of viable, leukocyte-rich cells or tissue for cell-associated diseases [21 CFR 1271.85(b)(1)]. For example, semen was collected from directed donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) . However, the donor was not tested for Human T-lymphotropic virus, types 1 and 2 (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). Directed semen donor (b)(6) was determined “eligible” on July 12, 2024. 3) Failure to screen a donor of reproductive cells or tissue by reviewing the donor’s relevant medical records for risk factors for, and clinical evidence of, relevant communicable disease agents and diseases [21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1)]. Your firm’s Donor Medical History Interview Questionnaire, FDA Donor Screening for Risk Factors or Conditions For Donor Eligibility Evaluator form is used as a relevant medical record to screen donors and determine their eligibility. This form is missing questions, timeframes, and/or deferral periods to assess a donor’s relevant communicable disease risk. For example: a. Question 6 states, “In the past 12 months, have you had sex with a person known or suspected to have HIV infection, active hepatitis B infection or hepatitis C infection, clinically active hepatitis B infection, or hepatitis C infection?” To adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of the disease, the question needs to ask about hepatitis B infection and clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection. b. Question 9 states, “In the past 12 months, have you been in jail for more than 72 consecutive hours?” This question needs to ask about juvenile detention, lock up, and prison in addition to jail. c. The form fails to ask whether donors have tested positive or reactive for WNV infection using an FDA-licensed or investigational WNV NAT donor screening test in the preceding 120 days. d. The form fails to ask whether donors are current or former U.S. military members, civilian military employees, or dependents of a military member or civilian employee who resided at U.S. military bases in Northern Europe (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) for 6 months or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1990, or elsewhere in Europe (Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Italy) for 6 months or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1996. e. The form fails to ask whether donors have been diagnosed with Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) or any other form of CJD. 4) Failure to establish and maintain procedures for all steps performed in testing, screening, and determining donor eligibility, and complying with all other requirements of Subpart C “Donor Eligibility” [21 CFR 1271.45 - 1271.90]. “Establish and maintain” means define, document, and implement; then follow, review, and as needed, revise on an ongoing basis [21 CFR 1271.47(a)]. For example, your firm’s procedures do not include all steps and risk factors for donor screening, donor physical examination, steps and requirements for determining donor eligibility, and all additional relevant requirements in Subpart C of 21 CFR Part 1271. The violations identified above are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure that your establishment complies with all applicable federal regulations. You are responsible for reviewing your firm’s operations, including firms within the same organization, as a whole to ensure that you are in compliance with the law.

We have reviewed your response, and we have determined that the response is inadequate to address our concerns. In response to Observations 1 and 2, we acknowledge your commitment to retrain staff on the donor eligibility process and donor summary of records; however, you made this commitment previously and failed to honor it. On April 8, 2021, Louisville Reproductive Center was cited for similar violations and on April 12, 2021, you responded and stated that your staff would be retrained on the Donor Summary of Records which details all required testing for semen donors. Despite that commitment, the current inspection documented the same violations, indicating that your corrective actions were either not implemented or were not effective to prevent the recurrence of the previously identified violations. The Agency continues to have serious concerns about your establishment’s ability to maintain compliance with 21 CFR Part 1271. Please note that if you still have oocytes and/or semen in storage from donors whose screening and/or testing was not completed in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1271, FDA considers the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these donors.

Several studies have found improved reaction times, attention span, and short-term memory in test subjects using small doses.” • “Mood Stabilization o Low-dose nicotine has been observed to improve mood, particularly under stress. It can enhance the brain’s reward system without the overstimulation seen in traditional energy drinks or synthetic compounds.” Your “Nicotina Energy Citrus Surge Lite 3 MG” and “Nicotina Energy Grapefruit Spark Lite 3 MG” products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the above-described conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, are in effect for these products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these unapproved new drug products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). Furthermore, please note that if you take corrective actions such that your products are no longer drugs, your products may meet the definition of a tobacco product under section 201(rr)(1) of the FD&C Act and thus would be required to comply with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products. 1 For instance, generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. In addition, products that meet the definition of a food under section 201(f) of the FD&C Act must comply with the requirements and prohibitions applicable to foods. Many substances intentionally added to beverages and other conventional foods are food additives. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any unapproved food additive used in a beverage or other conventional food causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act. Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States. Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may lead to regulatory or legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAAdvisory@fda.hhs.gov.

It is important to note that most of the time recall classifications are determined after the recalling firm provides all of the information needed to determine the risk posed to public health. The classification and posting in the FDA Enforcement Report should not be seen as an expansion or change to a firm’s voluntary public warning. Firms often initiate voluntary recalls and provide public statements or notifications as part of their commitment to protecting consumers, which may occur well before the FDA completes its classification process and subsequently posts to this report.

FDA can place a product on an Import Alert after discovering a violation and then detain future shipments of the product without having to test or otherwise physically examine it. FDA refers to this as “detention without physical exam” or “DWPE”. If a product subject to DWPE is offered for import, it will be detained and refused unless the importer can overcome the appearance of the violation(s) by demonstrating to the FDA that the product does not have the violation(s) listed on the import alert. The “Guidance” section of each import alert provides more information on what evidence may be appropriate. Fast Facts about Import Alerts FD&C Act Section 801 (21 USC Section 381) of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act gives FDA the authority to refuse products that appear to be in violation of FDA laws and regulations. This is known as the “appearance standard”. The FDA issues “Import Alerts” to notify the public, the import community, and FDA staff of the products and firms that appear to be in violation of FDA laws and regulations. Violations could be related to the product, manufacturer, shipper, importer, Country of origin and/or other information. Each import alert lists the reason for the alert, what products and firms are affected, what FDA laws and/or regulations appear to have been violated, and other information. The “Guidance” section provides information on how DWPE is applied, how to secure a release of a shipment, how to be removed from the import alert, and contact information. Prior to importing into the United States, importers should determine if their products are subject to DWPE, and if so, become familiar with the instructions and possible evidence that will need to be presented to secure a release of the shipment. < > Search FDA's Import Alerts Import alert databases are updated in real time.

As we strive to ensure that food is recognized as a vehicle for wellness, recent incidents involving chemical contaminants in infant and toddler food products have raised public awareness and underscored our shared responsibility in safeguarding our most vulnerable consumers – our children. At the FDA, we believe that radical transparency in food safety and nutrition actions is key to reducing foodborne illness and chronic disease, setting a strong foundation for lifelong health. It is imperative the food industry and FDA work together to ensure swift, transparent, and effective recall communication, especially for products vital to infant and child nutrition. Today, we are seeking your assistance in creating a collaborative transformation in how we manage and communicate food recalls, particularly for infant formula, baby foods, and foods intended for children, to provide for greater public awareness of these recalls. We are encouraging our industry partners to enhance communication with the public and continue to work with the FDA when a product is recalled. And we are welcoming industry leaders’ input on how industry and the FDA can communicate recalls faster and in formats that leverage new digital tools. Industry Call to Action The FDA’s ability to make informed decisions and disseminate crucial updates to consumers hinges on industry providing prompt notification of recall information to the agency. Recognizing this interdependence, we kindly remind firms to inform the FDA immediately when a decision to initiate a recall is made, as outlined in 21 CFR 7.46(a) and 107.210(a). Recognizing the public’s desire to have more information about recalled FDA-regulated foods, particularly foods for infants and children, the FDA appreciates the public may want firms to issue public notifications for a broader range of situations than previously experienced. For food safety issues in products for infants and children, firms should consider expanded use of public notification as appropriate to ensure that consumers have access to the most timely and comprehensive information. FDA Actions to Improve Transparency Industry and government recall systems must evolve to meet the public's need for timely information. We are proposing a strategic overhaul, leveraging communications best practices as well as cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize how we work together to collect, analyze, and disseminate crucial recall information. Our vision includes: Short term goals Enhancing public access to critical recall information by creating a centralized, consumer-focused webpage for streamlined access to recall information, with an emphasis on infant formula, baby foods, and foods intended for children. Evaluating internal and external recall communication protocols on public communications for certain recall situations, ensuring alignment with current best practices and public health priorities. Improving recall data granularity and accessibility by upgrading the FDA Enforcement Report system to allow for more refined and targeted filtering of recall information by the public, particularly for sensitive food categories. Improving the reach and clarity of our recall communications by leveraging focus group research and other stakeholder feedback on risk communication strategies. Further increasing the speed of recall classification through process improvements. Long term goals Optimizing recall information collection by redesigning and digitizing key recall documentation to support automated data extraction and AI-assisted analysis, improving overall recall process efficiency. Modernizing data submission infrastructure through implementation of an advanced digital platform for industry partners to submit standardized data, enhancing efficiency in recall information processing, dissemination, and recall classification. These enhancements, which require increased public-private partnerships, and sufficient resources and time, are aimed at achieving radical transparency, and empowering parents and caregivers to monitor the products they purchase or have in their home and safeguard their children's immediate safety and long-term health outcomes. This initiative reflects our commitment to increased collaboration with industry leaders, focused on placing the public’s needs first, empowering parents, protecting our children, and fostering a healthier future for generations to come.

Other symptoms include fever, headache, and body ache. A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing up. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy. If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your healthcare provider Summary of Problem and Scope The Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Aquaculture is conducting a recall of oysters from Norm Bloom and Son (CT-069-SS, AQ), harvested from Westport, CT, lot 207, with the harvest date 2/20/2024, because they are associated with a norovirus outbreak in Minnesota and may be contaminated with norovirus. The oysters were distributed to restaurants and retailers in CT, FL, GA, MA, MD, ME, MN, NJ, OH, RI, SC, and TX, and may have been distributed to other states as well. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat, and restaurants and food retailers not to sell, and to dispose of these oysters. Contaminated oysters can cause illness if eaten raw, particularly in people with compromised immune systems. Food contaminated with norovirus may look, smell, and taste normal. Consumers of these products who are experiencing symptoms of norovirus illness should contact their healthcare provider, who should report their symptoms to their local Health Department. FDA Actions The FDA is sharing the notice of the CT oyster recall and advising consumers not to eat, and restaurants and food retailers not to sell, oysters from Norm Bloom and Son (CT-069-SS, AQ), harvested from Westport, CT, lot 207, with the harvest date 2/20/2024, and distributed to restaurants and retailers in CT, FL, GA, MA, MD, ME, MN, NJ, OH, RI, SC, and TX. The FDA is awaiting information on further interstate distribution of the oysters and will continue to monitor the investigation and provide assistance to state authorities as needed. Recommendations for Restaurants and Retailers Restaurants and retailers should not serve or sell the potentially contaminated oysters. Restaurants and retailers should dispose of any products by throwing them in the garbage or returning them to their distributor for destruction. Restaurants and retailers should also be aware that shellfish may be a source of pathogens and should control the potential for cross-contamination of food processing equipment and the food processing environment. They should follow the steps below: Wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process. Retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any potentially contaminated products need to be concerned about cross-contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products. Retailers that have sold bulk product should clean and sanitize the containers used to hold the product. Regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of food contact surfaces and utensils used in food preparation may help to minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination. Recommendations for consumers Consumers should not eat the potentially contaminated oysters. Consumers who have symptoms should contact their health care provider to report their symptoms and receive care.

Consumers who have recently purchased oysters from area FL-3012 sold in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Product Wild harvest oysters from FL-3012, Cedar Key, Florida, harvested between December 16, 2022, and February 24, 2023. The oysters were distributed to restaurants and retailers in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia It is possible that additional states received these oysters through further distribution. Packaged oysters include harvest area information on the packaging. Purpose The FDA is advising consumers not to eat, and restaurants and food retailers not to sell, and to dispose of recalled wild harvest oysters from FL-3012, Cedar Key, Florida, harvested between December 16, 2022, and February 24, 2023, due to possible Salmonella contamination. These oysters were sold in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Consumers who purchased oysters after December 16, 2022, should check the packaging to see if they were wild harvest oysters from FL-3012, Cedar Key, Florida. Contaminated oysters can cause illness if eaten raw, particularly in people with compromised immune systems. Food contaminated with Salmonella may look, smell, and taste normal. Consumers of these products who are experiencing symptoms of salmonellosis should contact their healthcare provider, who should report their symptoms to their local Health Department. Summary of Problem and Scope The Florida Department of Health and the state health departments of Georgia and Alabama have detected a Salmonella outbreak associated with the consumption of raw oysters harvested from shellfish harvesting area FL-3012 in Cedar Key, Florida. To date, there have been 8 cases linked to this outbreak within Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. On February 24, 2023, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued an emergency closure order for wild harvest oysters from harvest area FL-3012 and initiated a recall of wild harvest oysters from harvest area FL-3012 in Cedar Key that were harvested from December 16, 2022, to February 24, 2023. On February 24, the State of Florida also notified the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference of the closure and recall. Florida Department of Health posted an advisory bulletin on February 28. 2023. FDA Actions The FDA is issuing this alert advising consumers not to eat, and restaurants and food retailers not to sell, recalled wild harvest oysters from FL-3012, Cedar Key, Florida, harvested between December 16, and February 24, 2023, due to possible Salmonella contamination. The FDA will assist with and coordinate interstate notification efforts as necessary pending receipt of shellfish distribution information. Symptoms of Salmonellosis Most people infected with Salmonella will begin to develop symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness, salmonellosis, usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. More severe cases of salmonellosis may include a high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, a rash, blood in the urine or stool, and in some cases may become fatal. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that approximately 450 persons in the United States die each year from acute salmonellosis. Due to the range in severity of illness, people should consult their healthcare provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a Salmonella infection. Recommendations for Restaurants and Retailers Restaurants and retailers should not sell the potentially contaminated oysters. Restaurants and retailers should dispose of any potentially contaminated products by throwing them in the garbage or returning to their distributor for destruction. Restaurants and retailers should also be aware that oysters and other filter-feeding bivalve molluscan shellfish may be a source of pathogens and should control the potential for cross-contamination of food processing equipment and the food processing environment. They should follow the steps below: Wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process. Retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any potentially contaminated products need to be concerned about cross-contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products. Retailers that have sold bulk product should clean and sanitize the containers used to hold the product. Regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of food contact surfaces and utensils used in food preparation may help to minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.

This recall involves removing certain devices from where they are used or sold. The FDA has identified this recall as the most serious type. This device may cause serious injury or death if you continue to use it. Affected Product The FDA is aware that AirLife has issued a letter to affected customers recommending certain Broselow Rainbow Tapes and Broselow ALS Organizers be removed from where they are used or sold. Affected devices: Product Description REF Number Lot Numbers Unique Device Identifier Broselow Pediatric Emergency Rainbow Tape 7700REA Rev. 3 All Lots Each- 10889483588970 Case- 30889483588974 Broselow Pediatric Emergency Rainbow Tape 7700RE Rev. 3 All Lots Each- 10889483588963 Case- 30889483588967 Broselow, ALS Organizer, Full 7730ALS Rev. 3 All Lots Each- 10889483589151 Broselow, ALS Organizer, Full 7730IALS Rev. 3 All Lots Each- 10889483589205 Case- 30889483589209 Broselow Rainbow Tape version with incorrect information is identified with the AirLife brand, 2025 Edition, and 36-23446 Rev 3 Print Version. What to Do Immediately identify, cease use, and discard affected product. On December 15, AirLife sent all affected customers a letter recommending the following actions: Stop using the affected tapes. Identify and segregate affected product Examine your inventory and clinical areas for affected Broselow Rainbow Tapes. Remove all affected tapes from clinical service Segregate or quarantine the affected tapes to prevent further use Follow disposition instructions Follow the instructions provided in the accompanying communication regarding discarding/destruction of the affected tapes. Do not redistribute or place any affected tapes back into service. Notify your internal users Ensure that all clinicians and healthcare professionals within your organization who may use the Broselow Rainbow Tape are informed of this recall/field removal and understand that the affected Rev 3 tapes must not be used. Notify downstream customers (if applicable) If you have further distributed the affected tapes, please identify your customers/consignees and notify them of this recall/field removal promptly. Your notification may be enhanced by including a copy of this letter. If you have impacted product on hand, do not ship it; instead, hold it for discarding/destruction as instructed. Check this web page for updates. The FDA is currently reviewing information about this potentially high-risk device issue and will keep the public informed as significant new information becomes available. Reason for Recall AirLife stated that the affected product version contains three medication-related errors: Vecuronium In the Calculation Basis “Red to Head” reference section, the dosage is shown as 0.1 mg/mL (concentration) instead of the correct 0.1 mg/kg (weight-based dose). This medication is a neuromuscular blocking agent used to produce paralysis during intubation or mechanical ventilation. The incorrect dosing information can lead to confusion and potential delays as clinicians interpret or convert the dosing information in an emergency. Because the tape is used in time-sensitive critical care environments, such delays or confusion can contribute to serious patient harm, including hypoxia, failed or delayed intubation, or other life-threatening complications. Flumazenil In the Calculation Basis “Red to Head” section, the dosage is shown as 0.1 mg/kg instead of the correct 0.01 mg/kg. The color-coded sections of the tape list the correct Flumazenil dose, but the reference table is incorrect and represents a 10-fold overdose. This medication is used primarily to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, including in pediatric patients. Potential consequences of an elevated Flumazenil dose include seizures, withdrawal symptoms, re-sedation, cardiac arrhythmias, agitation or anxiety, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating, and blurred vision. Ketamine (IV/IO for pain/analgesia) The tape lists IV/IO ketamine for pain/analgesia as 1 mg/kg, whereas the appropriate pediatric analgesic (sub-dissociative) dose is 0.1 mg/kg. This represents a 10-fold overdose and may result in a dissociative sedation dose being administered when only analgesia was intended. Potential clinical consequences of administering 1 mg/kg IV/IO ketamine for analgesia include dissociative sedation, respiratory depression or apnea, loss of airway reflexes, potential airway collapse, laryngospasm, increased secretions with risk of aspiration, hypertension and tachycardia, emergence agitation, prolonged recovery time, and need for assisted ventilation or advanced airway management. The clinical consequences for incorrect medication doses based on the printed information may be serious or life-threatening. As of November 14, AirLife has not reported any serious injuries or deaths associated with this issue. Device Use The Broselow Rainbow Tape is a color-coded length-based tape used in pediatric emergencies. A child’s height corresponds to a color zone and weight range. Each color zone provides pre-calculated medication doses, equipment sizes, and other emergency information to reduce the time needed for dose and equipment calculations in time-critical situations. Contact Information Customers in the U.S. with adverse reactions, quality problems, or questions about this issue should contact AirLife at productquality@myairlife.com or 1-800-433-2797.

Recalls may be conducted on a firm's own initiative, by FDA request, or by FDA order under statutory authority. Class I recall: a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Class II recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. Class III recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. Market withdrawal: occurs when a product has a minor violation that would not be subject to FDA legal action. The firm removes the product from the market or corrects the violation. For example, a product removed from the market due to tampering, without evidence of manufacturing or distribution problems, would be a market withdrawal. Medical device safety alert: issued in situations where a medical device may present an unreasonable risk of substantial harm. In some case, these situations also are considered recalls.", "relevance": 12, "mentions": []}

FDA works with industry and our state partners to publish press releases and other notices about recalls that may potentially present a significant or serious risk to the public health. On FDA’s recalls website, FDA provides information about a product being recalled, including the brand name, product description, the reason/problem, the company conducting the recall, related press release(s), and a picture of the product (when available). For major product recalls (for example, when a recall may affect multiple products), FDA also provides a searchable database of products affected by recall. As needed, FDA has also supported industry efforts to enable consumers to distinguish products not subject to recall from recalled products. For example, during the pistachio product recall in 2009, FDA’s website provided a link (with an appropriate disclaimer) to an industry-sponsored website that listed firms that had informed the industry sponsors of the website that the firms’ products did not contain recalled pistachios. If FDA is aware of confusion in the marketplace about products that may be implicated in a food outbreak, and information gathered by industry or other sources may serve to alleviate that confusion, FDA will support efforts by industry and others to communicate information to consumers about products not subject to a recall when sufficiently reliable information about products not connected with the recall exist, if FDA concludes that disclosing the information is in the interest of public health. More detailed information about FDA’s current thinking on product recalls is provided on the Industry Guidance webpage . Recalling firms who are aware of confusion and would like assistance from FDA in communicating to the public regarding which food products are subject to recall should contact the recall coordinator in their district. Industry members who would like assistance in communicating to the public when they are aware of confusion regarding which food products are subject to recall should contact the FDA, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, Recall Team at CFSAN.Recall@fda.hhs.gov .", "relevance": 8, "mentions": []}

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. The recalled cucumbers were sold directly to consumers at the three Bedner’s Farm Fresh Markets locations in Florida (Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach). Because the recalled cucumbers do not bear any stickers or other labeling, customers should discard and not consume any cucumbers that were purchased at these locations between April 29, 2025, and May 14, 2025. The recalled cucumbers also were sold to a wholesale distributor, which has been directed to further contact its customers with recall instructions. The cucumbers are being recalled because they have been linked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to a Salmonella outbreak that has resulted in 26 illnesses in AL, CA, CO, FL, IL, KS, KY, MI, NC, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, and VA. This recall does not include any cucumbers currently available for sale at Bedner’s Farm Fresh Markets after May 14, 2025, nor does it include any other agricultural products. All cucumbers currently available for sale at Bedner’s Farm Fresh Markets were not grown by Bedner Growers, Inc., as the company is no longer producing, packing, or selling any cucumbers because the growing season has concluded.

There have been no illnesses or consumer complaints reported, in connection with the specific products listed below, to date.

Smucker Company facility in Lexington, Kentucky. CDC’s review of epidemiological information indicates that five out of five people reported consuming peanut butter and four of the five people specifically reported consuming different varieties of Jif brand peanut butter prior to becoming ill. FDA conducted Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis on an environmental sample collected at the Lexington, KY, J.M. Smucker Company facility in 2010. The analysis shows that this 2010 environmental sample matches the strain causing illnesses in this current outbreak. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that Jif brand peanut butter produced in the J.M. Smucker Company facility located in Lexington, KY, is the likely cause of illnesses in this outbreak. J.M. Smucker Company has voluntarily recalled certain Jif brand peanut butter products that have the lot code numbers between 1274425 – 2140425, only if the first seven digits end with 425 (manufactured in Lexington, KY).

Smucker Co.’s voluntary recall of select Jif products in the United States has prompted Fresh Del Monte to voluntarily recall fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products containing ready-to-eat Jif peanut butter dip due to the potential presence of Salmonella contamination. In response and out of an abundance of caution, Fresh Del Monte is recalling the following products, which were sold to retailers nationwide: Del Monte Apples with Peanut Butter (5 ounce) Peanut Butter Snack Pack (4.25 ounce), Apples and Peanut Butter (6 ounce, and 5.5 ounce), and Sandwich with Peanut Butter Cup. This recall does not affect any other Fresh Del Monte portfolio items, which are completely safe, and not implicated as the source of this recall. The scope of this Fresh Del Monte recall is very limited as it relates to the company’s portfolio and only affects a few products containing J.M. Smuckers’ Jif peanut butter. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis. Consumers can review the official J.M Smucker Co. FDA press release here . Products subject to the voluntary recall of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables are packaged in clear plastic containers with a tamper-evident seal and identified with a Del Monte “Best If Used By” (DM BIUB) date on, or before, May 30, 2022. Consumers can identify the recalled product using the information in the table at the end of this release. Consumers who still have any of these products in their refrigerators are urged not to consume the product and discard it immediately. Retailers have been advised to check store shelves and warehouse inventories to confirm that no recalled product is available for purchase by consumers. Any Jif peanut butter snack packs that were packed in fruit snack trays from September 1, 2021, through May 20, 2022, that may be still on hand should be disposed of as well.

Brand Name: Brand Name(s) Thomson Premium, TLC Thomson International, Tender Loving Care, more Product Description: Product Description Red, Yellow, White and Sweet Yellow Onions Company Announcement Thomson International Inc. of Bakersfield, California is recalling Red, Yellow, White, and Sweet Yellow Onions shipped from May 1, 2020 through the present. The onions are being recalled because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella , an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Onions were distributed to wholesalers, restaurants, and retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. The onions were distributed in 5 lbs. carton. 10 lbs. carton. 25 lbs. carton. 40 lbs. carton, 50 lbs. carton. bulk, 2 lb. mesh sacks, and 3 lb. mesh sacks, 5 lb. mesh sacks, 10 lb. mesh sacks 25 lbs. mesh sacks, 50 lbs. mesh sacks under the brand names Thomson Premium, TLC Thomson International, Tender Loving Care, El Competitor, Hartley’s Best, Onions 52, Majestic, Imperial Fresh, Kroger, Utah Onions and Food Lion. Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve red, white, yellow, or sweet onions from Thomson International, Inc. or products containing such onions. If you cannot tell if your onion is from Thomson International Inc., or your food product contains such onions, you should not eat, sell, or serve it, and should throw it out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Newport infections that may be linked to these onions, so Thomson International is recalling the onions out of an abundance of caution. As of now no specific source of contamination or contaminated shipment has been identified, and FDA is also investigating other potential sources of contamination and has not yet reached a final conclusion. 396 total illnesses have been reported to date including 59 hospitalizations. States with cases include: AK (6), AZ (14), CA (49), CO (10), FL (3), ID (5), IL (10), IN (2), IA (15), KS (1), KY (1), ME (4), MD (1), MI (23), MN (10), MO (6), MT (33), NE (5), NV (5), NY (4), NC (3), ND (5), OH (7), OR (71), PA (2), SC (1), SD (11), TN (5), TX (1), UT (61), VA (4), WA (2), WI (5), and WY (11).

The onions are sold loose in bulk bins. The red onions have a PLU sticker with the brand name Pacific Gold. No other Progressive Produce onions or other products are impacted by this recall.

These recalls are due to concerns of the potential for contamination by Salmonella spp. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. The Taylor Farms TX products subject to the recall are limited to the code dates listed below. No other Taylor Farms products are impacted by this recall.

Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, a Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. On December 18, 2019 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration notified Almark Foods that the company’s Hard-Boiled and Peeled eggs in pails manufactured at the Gainesville facility may be associated with a Listeria monocytogenes outbreak that has been linked to several reported illnesses and one reported death. A more recent FDA sample from the facility also matched the outbreak strain, suggesting the possibility that the strain may have remained present in the facility. Out of an abundance of caution, Almark is voluntarily expanding its recall to include all product packaged for the retail market manufactured at its Gainesville plant that remains within shelf life. This includes product with “Best If Used By” dates up through March 2, 2020. Almark has also temporarily suspended all production at its Gainesville plant. The affected product can be identified by viewing the printed “Best If Used By” date coding on the product package. If the “Best If Used By” code starts with the prefix “G”, the product was manufactured at the company’s Gainesville, Georgia facility and is subject to this recall. Products with the prefix “N” or “Y” are not subject to this recall. For Protein Kit products, consumers are advised to check the code on the actual egg package within the kit.

Company Name: Gold Star Distribution, Inc. Brand Name: Brand Name(s) Multiple brand names Product Description: Product Description All FDA-regulated products held at facility including drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, dietary supplements, human food, and pet food Company Announcement MINNEAPOLIS – December 26, 2025 —Gold Star Distribution, Inc. (Gold Star or “the Company”) is recalling all FDA regulated products listed in this press release due to the presence of rodent and avian contamination. Persons handling or consuming the products could become seriously ill due to adulteration from pests, including rodents, birds and insects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that the facility was operating under insanitary conditions, including the presence of rodent excreta, rodent urine, and bird droppings in areas where medical devices, drugs, human food, pet food, and cosmetic products were held. These conditions create a significant risk that products held at the facility may have been contaminated with filth and harmful microorganisms. Products held under insanitary conditions may become contaminated through contact with contaminated surfaces or exposure to airborne particulates associated with animal waste. Exposure to contaminated products can pose serious health risks to consumers, including the potential for bacterial contamination, which may result in illness or infection, including Salmonella . There are numerous hazards associated with rodents including the potential presence of Salmonella . Use or consumption of affected products may present risk of illness due to the potential presence of Salmonella , an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in infants, young children, frail or elderly people, pregnant persons, persons with pre-existent pathology (e.g., patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy treatments, organ transplant recipient, etc.) and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis. Additionally, products contaminated with filth, rodent excreta, and rodent urine may cause illness in the animals that consume the food or humans that are in contact with the products. Rodents are the main reservoirs of Leptospira the bacteria that causes leptospirosis in humans and animals. Contaminated medical devices may increase the risk of device-associated infections, drugs and foods may cause adverse health effects if ingested, and cosmetics applied to the skin or eyes may lead to skin irritation, infection, or other adverse reactions.
